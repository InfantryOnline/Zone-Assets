~B~1Free Infantry Staff list as of March, 2015~B~1


~B~2Overview:~B~2

~2-Moderators are volunteers that are present in the game to help players
and enforce the rules.

-Contacting Moderators can be done by using the ?help command (?help player
is TKing me), adding the !911 chat (?chatadd !911) or by searching for them
individually (?find Ace) and private messaging them.

?help Command: When using this command always remember to put a reason after
it. It helps Moderators react faster to your request. These requests are seen
immediately by local Moderators and by global ones upon checking the list.

!911 Chat: Only enter this chat for rule violation reports. Upon entering
the chat, state your purpose and ?chatdrop !911 as soon as you are done or
when a Moderator asks you to.

Private Messaging: There are no rules for this method of contact. It is best
suited for receiving lengthy help from available Moderators.

-Moderators do not operate in private areas of the game. This includes
private messages, private chats, private arenas, league zones, etc.

-Administrators have the ability to code, rotate zones, fix bugs, and handle
account related issues. They also oversee all Moderators.

-The Head Moderator is an Administrator who has the responsibility of managing
the addition and removal of Moderators.
