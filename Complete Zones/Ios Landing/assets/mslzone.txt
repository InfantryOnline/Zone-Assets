~BPart 1: Zone Rules~B

~41.1 Usl zone is considered a league zone.~2 Any arena within this zone is under the supervision of the league admin.
A league admin is then under the supervision of the server admins/head mods. Moderators can intervine to help assist the league admin on any abuse.

~41.2 League Admin~2 - He/She can power/de-power people that are not moderated across all zones(Developers/Granted Powers/Referees).
For powering - if requested by a captain of a squad or to be a mix hoster.
For depowering - if requested by a captain, abuse, or no longer needed as a mix hoster.
He/she will be in charge of what map will be played.

~41.3 Arena's named "Public"~2 - Public arena's will be controlled by a public vote on having the arena opened or locked for mixes. 
The hoster of the mix will be the controller of this arena. 
Any powered alias must respect the wishes of the hoster. 
If the hoster transfers who will be in charge, the person in charge will become the hoster.
For anyone powered that enters, they must ask who is hosting first, if there isnt a hoster then the person wanting to be the hoster MUST ASK the arena(public) if a mix can be ran. 
Do not assume you can take control without the public or the hoster's consent. This can be considered as an abuse of power so please, BE RESPECTFUL!

~41.4 Private arenas~2 - Private arena's are controlled by the person that made the arena. 
The league admin can supervise but is not allowed to modify the actual game play without the consent of the owner. If it is squad practice, he/she must have consent to take over. 
If it is a squad battle(sb), both captains or vice captains(depending on who is running it) of 
the private sb will be in charge of the arena. They have the power to say who can/cannot join the arena unless its the league admin, moderators or the server admins. 
If the league admin or any moderator/admins are the abusers, the owner/captains
can request a removal to any moderator/admin in the arena and must abide by the captains request.
If he/she does not follow the request, this will be considered abuse and punishable.
