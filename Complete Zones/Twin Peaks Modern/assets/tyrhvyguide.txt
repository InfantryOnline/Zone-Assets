I) Introduction

	I started Infantry a long time ago, and the first class I played was the 
heavy weapons.
Back then, we had the beachball Plasma Cannon and Mortars. Times have 
changed, and so have the
weapons and armor. I have played as a heavy for the past 5 Seasons of CTFPL, 
and I am fond of
using the class in public play as well. LETS BEGIN.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

II) Getting started

	The heavy weapons is a great class to start as, and also a wonderful asset 
to any team.
Alot of people say that heavy is the easiest class, but I beg to differ. 
There is no "easiest"
class, and there is no "hardest" class to play. I have always been a 
defensive person in sports
and games, protecting what needs to be protected, and being sluggish and 
strong on the battlefield.
The opinion of classes comes to how you view them and yourself.


a) Buying the right Heavy equipment

	To me, the best possible heavy armor set is:

Kevlite Combat Armor

PF Generator

SuitSuperCharger

	Some of you may prefer CMP4 or IDF Generator, but that is my personal 
setup. As for weapons, in public play
I like to use whatever I feel like using, and you should, too!

I always carry with me:

4 Frag Grenades

4 WP Grenades

20 bullet mines

5 EMP mines

2 energizers

Stim Pack

        The heavies weapons are normally stand and fire, so having some 
sidearms to grab at while you dance
is very useful. Only reason I carry EMP mines is because they do no damage 
to you, while dealing great drain
and damage to the idiot that is on top of you :) Here is a list of weapons 
and my favorites. (note: my
rating system is broken)

Kuchler LMG: Starting weapon for heavies. Slow burst, but gets the job done. 
Move and fire. 2/5 xylophones

Maklov LMG: If you want to use an LMG, use this. Fast firing burst, feels 
like the AR counterpart. 4/5 potatos

RPG: The master of Offense. Moves, grooves, destroys. Watch out on the 
minimum range. 5/5 cups

Kuchler PC: Eh, I guess it is fun. 2/5 yo-yos

Maklov PC: Quicker version, yet heavier. 3/5 desks

Micro Missile Launcher: Some complain about it, some abuse it. Overpowered 
weapon in all its glory. Why don't I like using it :(  4/5 P's

Recoiless Rifle: Great weapon on offense, just slow, slow transition time. 
3/5 tassels

Maklov AC: Most popular Heavy weapon. Sleek,smooth,sexy feel. 5/5 phones

Steiner AC: 10 shot clip, 2x the reload of Maklov. Used for long trips and 
turret happy engys. 3/5 carpets

Kamenev SC: 2 shot burst, quick reload. Yes, a great weapon. 3/5 Ocean 
Avenues

Unittech SC: If I could use you all the time and win I would. 5shot burst, 
insane reload. Glorious. 9/9 Super Stars

Gauss Cannon: It used to be more powerful. 4 Shots will kill. 3/5 Yankees

Both MGs: Use for fun only, an LMG is more useful :(  2/5 envelopes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

III) Role of the Heavy

	Heavies are made to kill. Kill players and machines. Kill anything that is 
red. Shoot anything
and everything that moves. Since heavies are stand and fire (exception of 2 
weapons), they are the
4th support class, although not listed. You are there to support and help 
your team. You kill the
enemy, or you kill the enemy's turret. You are the backbone of the Defense, 
and the savior of the
Offense.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV) Defending Your Base (D heavy)

	Ah, my favorite position. Everyone looks to the D heavy for taking out the 
trash. A heavy dosn't
make a defense, though. All members of the defense are vital, but the heavy 
is the King of the Base.
If the defense dies, they normally attach to the medic or the heavy, 
depending on the offense power.
People do tend to say alot of the time that the D Infantries are there to 
protect the heavy, and that is
false. A good heavy can always protect himself, and when a heavy can prove 
this to his partners, they
do not need to worry about saving the heavy. I will talk about the 2 main 
bases for Twin Peaks, and
my suggestions for them.

A7 (Collective Side)

Home, sweet, home. The A7 base is great for anti-flaggers, and can stop 
power offenses if conducted
correctly. Mine up when you come home, because they are not just there for 
damage, but to use enemy
repulsors. I like to put mines in spots where a rep is forced, especially 
with infiltrators in game.

Normally, I stand Half to 3 quarters of the way up the main channel, giving 
me plenty of room to fire.
You may find a different position helpful to you and your team, and that is 
alright. if you are an agressive
player, you might want to start a bit closer to the Infantries, a passive 
further back. For weapons at
this base, I start with the Maklov AC and the Micro Missile Launcher. If the 
enemy gets passed the AC
and attacks me, the MML has a great chance of connecting due to the open 
area. I have seen heavies use
AutoCannon/StubCannon setups, and depending on the heavy, can work wonders.

My Ammo Split for AC/MML is:

200 MG Ammo

20 Rockets

Overweight by 17%

I like to be positive about clearing the enemy with AC, and having little 
MML to fall back on makes me
want to due my job quicker. If you prefer SC/RPG at this base (maybe for 
fun, or a lacking offense) you
will be 2% overweight if you carry what I carry.

D7 (Titan Side)

D7 is a strong base with the right defense attached to it. 99% of the time, 
the heavy stands at Turn2.
This gives the heavy time to fall back and a wall to protect him, or to 
charge if the Offense dies fast.
You may want to find your favorite spot in D7 and get comfortable. My main 
setup here is the Maklov AC
and the Unittech SC.

250 MG Ammo, no split :)

With all the fixing, you will be 0% overweight. Hooray!

Keep the enemy in front of you at all times in this base, heavies can die 
quite quickly in this base if
you do not pay attention. Mines are usually good ideas, but a correct rep 
from the Offense sends a plasma mine
right into your wall, dealing damage to you quickly AND pulling you towards 
them. AC/SC tends to work great
here, MML isn't so desired unless you just want to try and hit the first 2 
rockets, but then again AC does
the same thing, but faster. LMG and AC or SC is a quick heavy's setup if you 
want to fight with your Infs.


Quick summary of what to use and where to use it.

A7 (Collective Side)

Long hallway. Make great use of it. AC/MML works great, as does SC/RPG (aim 
sold seperately). Make sure you
split your ammo to your liking. If you don't mind being heavy, carry a bit 
more. AC/SC can be used if you think MML
is too slow. Can't tell you against what offenses to use what weapons, that 
must be found out on your own :)

D7 (Titan Side)

Quick turns. MML is out of the question here. SC can be great, but you might 
need explosive. AC/SC is my first
try here. If that dosn't work, try SC/RPG if you are courageous, but AC/SC 
should work if used correctly.
LMG/SC is good vs an Infil/JT offense (hint).



REMEMBER: ALWAYS WATCH WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WHERE YOUR TEAMMATES ARE. KEEP 
THEM CLEAN, AND THEY DO THERE JOB
BETTER. HEAVIES CANNOT WORK ALONE. THESE ARE MY SETUPS, AND YOU DO NOT NEED 
TO USE THEM.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V) Attacking Your Enemy (O heavy)

	Heavies can almost always be used on an offense, especially as turret 
killers. When at turrets, make sure
your team knows to help keep you alive. Teams win games, not Cowboys.

A7 (Collective Side)

Long hallway again. What should we use?

RPG: Goes great with ANYTHING here. Moves the D. Kills the D. Hurts the 
turrets.

AC: Clears the way for your teammates. Also clears turrets with ease.

SC: Although dosn't hurt MGs/RTs, it clobbers the defense.

MML: Holding down MML does in fact work here.

~BLets mix and match.~B

AC/RPG: You have a multi-shot bruiser, and a rocket launcher. Switch between 
them to kill quickly. AC the turrets. Although
	left with no short range weapon, make sure your offense can help if you 
need it.

AC/SC: SC works great on killing defense, AC for turrets.

AC/MML: A Defensive setup on O never hurts. MML can be used for both enemies 
and turrets.

SC/RPG: If you get to turrets with this, switch to AC.

SC/MML: Don't even :)

Make sure you kill your enemy off before attempting to hurt the turrets. You 
will get more done with 10
extra seconds.


D7 (Titan Side)

Heavies CAN be so useful here, but you need to know what you are doing. RPG 
is really only useful to get thru turn1 and 2, then its
bleh vs turrets. AC can keep everyone on their toes, as well as SC. MML is 
still out of the question unless you are using it
to clear the top area. So our choices again are:

SC
RPG
MML
AC

AC/RPG is probably the best for this situation. Stay high and dry in the 
base, space in your ally.
Don't cut corners sharply, ease around in curves. If you take your time and 
line yourself up with
the turn itself, you can place RPGs in great lines that will move the 
Defense in ways they don't want to be moved.
SC/RPG is great for speed, but you wont do much with turrets. You can just 
kill people if you want, but
noone clears the flag room like you.

REMEMBER: KEEP YOUR SL SUPPLIED WITH STIMS, STAY BEHIND YOUR OFFENSE, KEEP 
YOUR TEAMMATES IN SIGHT, AND
DESTROY ALL RED YOU SEE.

VI) Miscellaneous tips and tricks

1. Demo packs are wonderful tools. Use them to get people off of you 
quickly, or use them to set a quick
"roadblock" for the enemy. Stupids will hit them!

2. Although it is fun to bounce grenades off walls, you won't hit often. 
Backpedal and tossing causes
a quicker decrease of angle, making grenades hit a bit more often.

3. Although you can't right now in public, EB is neat with heavies. Try an 
MML/EB setup for lots of fun.

4. It is always ok to zoom in and out if you need to. Just be careful you 
don't get snuck up on.

5. Whether you like them or not, sports zones can help you with long 
distance aiming and other various tactics.

6. NEVER SWING UNLESS TOLD TO.

7. Always have fun playing as a heavy, or any other class you choose.
