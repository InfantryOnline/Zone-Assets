The MVP Bonus total is 1/3rd the jackpot.

The WINNING team will get an MVP bonus equal to HALF the MVP Jackpot distributed based upon their MVP percentage.

The LOSING teams will get and MVP bonus equal to the MVP jackpot distributed based upon their MVP percentage.

This will mean that Losing teams will still get a decent MVP bonus if they are playing well and contributing. This
will ALSO benefit teams that TRY to win as opposed to just running around in groups getting kills.

*********July 25th, 2001

We are implementing a new MVP flag reward system. At the time you win a game you will get a base reward, plus an MVP reward based upon your MVP rating.

These are the stats tracked for MVP followed by their importance.

Kills: Slightly Important
Deaths: Slightly Negative
Vehicle Kills: Moderately Important (read turrets and players on vehicles)
Vehicle Deaths: slightly Negative
Flag Captures: VERY important
Carry Time: VERY important
Combined Carry Time:Slightly Important
Flag Carry Kills: Important
Flag Carrier Kills: VERY important
Team Owned Factor: Slightly Important
Combined team Ownage: Slight importance

These stats will have to be tweaked. When the settings are satisfactory THERE WILL BE A DATABASE WIPE.
This WILL be the new reward system used.
