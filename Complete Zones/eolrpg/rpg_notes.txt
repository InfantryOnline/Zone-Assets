Any class is able to pickup Resources now. This is to encourage team-basing. If you're an Engineer, or a Tech, ask the players on your team to grab you some Resources to maintain the base.

Minor Resource Points were altered. They have now adopted an Experience reward. 10 Minors are equivalent to 1 Resource Point in respects to the Experience reward.

1/6/06

Decreased the Ambulance Vehicle Ignore Armor.
Reason: it has an onboard repair kit.

PR-MO gained some attribute requirements.

The Flag Game was removed.
All Resource Points and Major Resource points will appear now.

Beefed rewards on the Carry-type flags.
More specifically, Elite Unit Standard gained a cash reward on top of it's previous reward status. A similar beef occured to Mercenaries Standard, which gained an experience reward.
The reward rate for these two differs, this is to maintain an importance either of them have.
On a similar note, another Carry-type flag was added called "Citizens Standard" located at K11.

Commands are as follows:
*Grant
*Team
*Spec
*Goto
*Warp
*Summon
*Shutup

Hoverboard gained a speed increase and a bounce effect was added.
The height Hoverboard can gain is still the same so it isn't as great as Deathboard, so in this aspect it won't be taking JT users away from using Deathboard (you wish).
This change is to accommodate the Medical and Engineering tree classes. It has a good chance at gaining height onto Orange-type physics, but it doesn't have the mobility of the Deathboard.

Jump Trooper lost access to Vambraces.

Medic lost access to Kevlite Greaves.

Assassin is now restricted to PF in the Generator department.

Assassin has gained access to the following to provide the class with some variety:
Cloaking Unit
Shimmer Field
Improved Cloak
Cyclotron
Graviton Gun
Teleport Disruptor
Demolition Charge
Boots - Armored
Boots - Blast
Boots - Thermax

Assassin's hyperthrust energy cost was increased and so was it's hyperspeed.

SciOps gained access to PR-MO 313X.

Alien Chief hitbox has been fixed.

The rewards on the helmet-type drops are twice the amount they would be if it were a Pirate counterpart.

Small increase to experience share percent.

Happy Hunting!


12/19/05

Raised decay times on Clear, Rough, Roadway to 5 minutes and Indoor to 3 minutes.
This will allow longer times on which dropped ammo, prizes, etc will remain before disappearing.

Updated First Aid for Medic. Gave the heal a slight increase and reduced the cost.
This will probably be the last refinement to Medic for some time.

Blackhole recieved a nerf to lifetime and a small reduction in it's pull.

Methane Grenade recieved a higher DOT effect.

Fixed the reload delays on the Dual PP08 & the PPA.

Gave all three PA's a proximity radius. This will allow more skilled marksmen a chance at outter damage, rather than a miss.

'Fixed' the problem with SAW.

Newbie area reworked a little. There will be Pirate Sergeants equiped with an IRLP that spawn in the tunnels.
In addition, the Spider spawn was also changed and will now spawn Spider Hives that are equiped with a lesser devastating attack.

Added a Wall Kit -Improved for Engineers, which build Wall - Advanced and require 5 Alloy to create.
These walls work the same as the Basic's with the same restrictions, however have an increased defense and more hit points.

Turned on Experience & Cash sharing.
The experience share percent is very low. This is intended so that bountier's bodyguards are awarded for protecting their bountier.
These are to encourage teams. Both radius' are limited and require you to be in the immediate area to recieve such rewards.

Fixed some descriptions & sellback prices (yes, Assassinate sellback), again.

Fixed some bugs, yet more still remain.

Upped Foam Dispenser energy cost, Foam should also hit enemy players now.

Ambulance is now restricted to Medic as far as driving/buying it goes.

Bio gained back Ceramax Greaves.



6/10/2005

Updated the Engineer and Tech innate repair.  They work like conventional repair kits, ie activate and select target of repair.

Updated Active Repair kits so they are more effective.

Changed the move model to better support solo play:

forward and backward accelleration is now the same.

Reverse Hyperthrust does not effect accelleration.

HyperThrust top speed is slightly higher than normal top speed.

This will increase whining about backpedaling, but will make it so that a group cannot easily run down a solo player, and it will make weapon
range bands more distinct, allowing players to take better advantage of weapon range disparities.


5/26/2005

Engineer/Tech repair items we re-worked.  Engineers and Techs now have an innate repair that is used in a similar manner to Turret Dismantle

2/1/2004

Temporarily changed the bounty system:

You will now gain bounty automatically at a set rate as long as you stay alive.

--More

redid weights on the slug rifles a bit.

Increased energy usage on field generators. They should be a choice, not a necessity.

Removed tech level reqs on all the field generators except DF/CS fields.

7/31/2003

Soft Armors protection levels were increased 5% across the board.

AR alternate rounds firing rate have all been changed to match that of the Titan AR AP round.

Carry weights have been lowered. The reason this process continues is because we finally get to see what ppl are carrying around with them
when they reach certain STR values.  This is probably the last time base carrying weights will be changed in any significant way.



7/30/2003

Assault Rifles all have a new type of alternate round.  Kuchler has an Incendiary Round, Maklov a Gas Tipped Explosive Round and the Titan Arms has an
Armor Piercing round.  The items cost more than normal ammunition.

Sonic Wave graphic was changed.
Sonic Rifle has a smaller graphic and a Smaller prox than before.

Recoil was removed from all weapons except Stand and Fire and Melee.  Recoil, as used within the context of the game, is not a good modelling device for the 
recoil effects of personal weapons.  

Flak Launcher was adjusted both to make it more effective and to limit the ability to "Wall Flak"

Flak Cannon fire rate was increased.

Rocket turrets now target vehicles/packs, not players on foot.

Mg and Plasma tier 1 turrets had their armor weakened a tad.

Needler/Flechette has their own ammo type now.

Energy usage on cloak/improved cloak/shimmer field was lowered.

Shimmer field gained some extra protection because it is very hard to target someone with a shimmer field on. In game terms this means some extra soft armor 
protection.

JT friction issue was addressed.

Alive time on the RR projectile was decreased.

Proton Beamer graphic was changed. The weapon rof was slown down a tad.

Standards were introduced.

There are 2 active Standards atm:  

Elite Unit Standard.  This standard gives an notoriety and exp reward every 15 minutes it is carried as well as giving a per kill bonus to the carrier.

Mercenaries Standard. This Standard gives a notoriety and cash reward every 15 minutes it is carried as well as giving a per kill bonus to the carrier.

Adjusted the movement model to be a tad slower, but more smooth then it was before.  Basically base thrust was lowered, as was friction.
This basically slowed things down, but movement feels smooth as before.

Changed the manner in which players stop team projectiles.  Now, you will block team projectiles, you will just take no damage (except for
large radius explosive weapons).  The benefit is now you will not trigger your own teams mines, and your teams autoturrets will no longer TK you.

Plasma weapons were changed in several ways.  First they now get 80% momentum from the shooter as opposed to the 55% of normal projectile weapons.
Next the cost of most plasma weapons was increased to reflect the higher tech nature of the weapons. Lastly, they received a graphical change.

Plasma Cannon(s) lifetime was reduced.

many slug projectile weapons had their shot velocity increased a small amount.

GP6 stun length was reduced. It is now less than the interval between shots from the GP6, which should allow the target to move in a stuttering sort of manner.
The target can still rotate as normal.

Assault rifle(s) weight was reduced.

Slug SMG(s) weight was reduced.

All shotguns and assault shotguns had their weight reduced.

All Slug pistols had their weight reduced.

Incinerator and Flame-thrower's damage was increased a very small amount.

Shimmer Field energy cost was reduced.

Improved Cloak energy cost was reduced.

Cloak energy cost was reduced.

Shock armor explosive protection was increased.

Infiltrators still have the highest base top speed.

PA $$ and PA EZ had their damage changed.

Most projectile velocities were increased a very small amount.

Flak Launcher and Flak cannon projectiles were give a far longer lifetime and otherwise tweaked to be more useful.

Aerial mines were totally changed. They now move around in an area roughly 250 pixels in diameter and the movement is in all directions.

PDB/Turret/Bunker armor was adjusted.

Shock Armor encumbrance values were lowered.

Many armors had their protection values increased on specific damage types.

Flame spots will not activate for a half second after it is created.  This should allow moving players to avoid instant triggering of Flame Spots.


3/28/2003

All explosive weapons will now damage everyone in the blast radius (some weapons did this before).

Captain/Sarge/SL's recharge and top speeds were adjusted.

The entry warp grid was tweaked.

3/21/2003

Enabled full collisions.  This means that your weapons will be stopped (collide with) team mates.  This does not mean they will
damage team mates however.  This will also mean that team mates will detonate mines, so be careful with your placement.

3/19/2003

Per shot speeds have been lowered on most weapons.

"Hard" armors have their encumberance modelled by detracting from your move ability. Wearing hard armours will slightly lower your
Top Speed, Rotation, and Thrust.

Changed team Sizes (again).

Redid the warp lio grid.  Hopefully this will help spread people around the map and minimise the likelihood of spawning in a firefight.

New Armor added: Thermax Shell
New Armor added: Thermax Breatplate.

Light and Heavy field converters can now be captured from their owners.  When their HP is in the red zone, Techs, Engineers, Chief Engineers and Captains
can "capture" them by right clicking on them and selecting "take Ownership".

-more

Loaded the wrong .itm and vehicle file version earlier. Sorry :(

Captains/Sarges had their speed increased modestly.

Shock Armor now encumbers the user modestly.

Legbound units now have gravity defined.

-More

Most projectile weapons shield drain was reduced a very small amount.

Most energy using weapons had thier energy use reduced.

JT Max energy raised to 600.


1/3/2003

Tuning Update:

Many people are questioning this update. It stemmed from the simple fact that armors were too strong, and new players had nearly no chance to compete.  Now things are a lot more balanced in favor of newer players. It is obvious after listening to some of the complaints that the differences between haves and have nots was too significant to be ignored.

The point of advancement in eol is not to be a tank. The point is as you advance you become more specialised in your career path.

Regardless, this zone is a work in progress.


-addendum

Most weapons had their energy drain reduced from 20-40% to adjust for the removal of shield drain protection of most armors.

PA got a mild beef.

Maklov Incinerator had it's damage lowered.
Maklov Heavy Flamer had it's damage type changed.

12/13/2002

Tuning update:

Dbslash made a little stronger to offset the loss of AP damage.

IRLP was weakened to put it more in line with other pistol class weapons.

Chainsword and Chainfist were buffed a small amount to offset the loss of AP damage.

Standard projectiles were given a VERY modest speed increase.

- Still debating on whether Flak needs to be returned to Medic/BioChem.

12/10/2002

Many adjustments are happening in preperation for new classes and other elements of the game.

Please bear this in mind.

Dropship recall has been completely removed.  A new Teleport subsystem has been added.
The Teleport subsystem is charge driven.  Each type of teleport uses a charge. Currently
there are 3 types of teleport charge: Recall, Random, and Team.  You can only carry one 
of each type of charge at a time.

Weapons and items have been re-categorised.

Grenades can drop on death as per other types of ammo.

The "Armour Piercing" damage category has been removed and replaced with a Psychic/Mental category.
Weapons using AP damage have been updated accordingly.

Medics and Biochems have lost the use of Laws/Demo Charges
Infils and SciOps have lost Laws/Flak

Summoners are less accurate.  Standard teleport summon is relatively inaccurate.  Command class
Summon gets more accurate the higher your rank.

Weapon changes:


Sonic Cannon exceptions fixed
PA's do Plasma damage instead of AP.
Laser class weapons now have no proximity trigger.

New weapon Added: IRLP909a Laser Pistol
New Item Added: Shimmer Field - A different type of visual/sensor cloaking device, the Shimmer Field renders the
                user transparent to normal vision and completely invisible to radar.





9/25/2002

Needler changed so that it only does bypass damage. It does 3/1 bypass with no kinetic.

New Weapon Added: Kuchler GSMG 202a. Guass Submachinegun.

DropShip recall now requires you to stand in place to activate. YOu cannot move and DS recall.
All summoning items are move and fire only.
Fixed teleport summoner drop bug.
All melee weapons shot times were lowered slightly.
Powersword energy usage lowered.

Most projectiles weapons were changed to inherit 50% momentum instead of 75% momentum.



9/4/2002

SR2000k had bypass damage removed.
Maser Cannon had it's inner explosive damage increased
Maser weight trigger adjusted.
You can no longer create packs/boards while on a pack/board.
Reload times and placement times of most mines now made uniform. It takes 2.5 seconds to place most mines.
-This may change as mines may get more lethal.

Hoverboards can Rotate while in the air, but not thrust.
Deathboards can now rotate AND thrust while airbourne.

New weapon added: FusionCorp IRLC911, a Cannon version of the IRL. Useable by SciOps and Heavy Weapons.

If you are one of the basic training classes, you cannot change to another basic training class.
This is a prelude to re-implementation of class tree's.  This means that their will be a definite career
path to follow with several choices based upon which basic training class is selected.
As in WZA, the Command classes will be a seperate tree that can be entered at any time if a player has the appropriate pre-reqs.
Free class changing to classes outside your career path will not be possible without a character wipe.




8/21/2002

Flak Launcher and Flak Cannon are now weight triggered to only hit packers/boarders.
Route range and live time were lowered on all PA models.
DeathBoard normal TopSpeed was decreased and HyperSpeed was increased.

2 new environmental effects were added: The Rockslide and the Meteor Shower.

-The Rockslides happen in the Southwest Hills and near the Northeast Ridge.

-Beware of meteors when crossing the bridges.

More to come...

Weapon Added: Aerial Mine
Item Added: PDB -- MG Kit
Vehicle Added: PDB - MG, Dual MG's of pain. Can change firing angle.

8/8/2002

Added Vertical Thrusters to FlightPack and DropPack. Vertical thrusters allow you to control your flight. They use energy.

FlightPack had Jump removed.

Added new Weapon:Unittech Flak Cannon. Automatic flak launcher that shoots less pellets per blast.

Gauss weapons projectile speeds were raised a small amount.

Repulsor charge/mine now have vertical recoil. Watch the JT's fly.

You no longer have your inventory reset when you change from a basic training military class to an advanced class.
You WILL have your inventory reset if you change down to a basic training class.

You no longer get free inventory items when you change from a basic training class to an advanced class.
Basic training classes still start with a basic loadout.

Class prerequisites were all redone and based upon attributes.  The EXP cost of the attributes required is roughly the same as the
EXP level you needed before the change. I am sorry if this messes anyone up, but it is better than using the other system.

7/25/2002

Team sizes are changed again.  The 5 main factions have 20. Minor factions have 15. Private teams have 12.

Items no longer drop when you die. Increased the prices on all items that were formerly droppable.

The map is coming along well. I am a particularly difficult area at the moment. Screen shots after this portion is complete.

7/14/2002

We are going to try things out from the other side now. The zone has been set to 3 man teams, with a couple of exceptions that will become apparent on their own. ;)

7/6/2002

Lowered the energy damage on most weapons. Some weapons were left unchanged because of their intended effect or percieved characteristics.

Increased the projectile speeds on both Plasma Cannon.
Changed the firing rates and magazine sizes on both guass rifles.
Adjusted kinetic damage downward on the needler.
Increased the inner energy damage on most grenades and explosives.
Lowered Medikit and Deluxe Medikit's effect range to a more manageable size.

For a temporary basis we are going to remove auto turrets from the zone entirely.  Engineers will have content themselves with creating pdb's and other structures that I will be adding shortly.

To further emphasise the importance of the various factions in Eol at the time of the collapse of the civil authorities, I am making pub teams very large.  Everyone can comfortably fit on one of the public teams. This is just a test so dont freak out. :)

Sonic Rifle shot rate increased.
Energy per shot increased on Zap Glove.
Shot rate on all melee weapons have been lowered.

If your team has no PDB's, you will spawn as normal.

5/23/2002

Maser is stand and fire and also requires a 5 Intellect to use. Otherwise it is unchanged.

5/22/2002

2/27/2002

Redid the team radar colouring.  Command classes show up in green, Medics/Bios show up in yellow, ppl on 
packs/boards show up grey and all other classes show up as a light blue. Enemies still show up as red.

Added new Item: Chain Sword
Added new Item: PowerSword
Added new Item: Combat Sword

Chain Fist had it's weight raised and strikes lowered to 2 before recovery. Damage was increased to offset the 
decrease.

Combat Axe had it's weight raised and strikes lowered to 2 before recovery. Damage was increased to offset the 
decrease.

Combat Knife now has 4 strikes before recovery (reload). 

2/26/2002

2/23/2002

Using the ?wipecharacter command will now completely wipe your character, EXP included.
Change classes, dont ?wipe.

Redid the weight carrying capacities. The stop weight remains the same, but the normal weight limit was lowered
5 KG across the board.

All units now have HyperThrust if they choose to use it. Shift+up/down is default.

Added new Item: Blackout Field
Added new Item: Kuchler PPA

Decreased the chance of dropping Sensors to 4.5%

Decreased the stun time of SR2002.


2/19/2002

Items lost due to death now drop at the place of death.
Fixed Stealth Generator.
Powercell's weight was reduced.

2/17/2002

Completely redid armor values from top to bottom, including field generators. It is worth noting that, although
armor values are not cumulative and dont add together, they do work in the order displayed on your Inventory list 
from top to bottom. I know this is somewhat counter-intuitive, but that is the way utility items work.

Completely redid the damage check values. I was assigning improper values based upon a incorrect understanding
of the parameters. Item loss do to battle damage should increase. Fields and sensors are more likely to be 
destroyed, armor items less likely. We'll see how it goes.

-The highest chance of battle damage effecting anything is 5% the lowest is 1.5% depending on the item.
-Primary armors and field generators are exempt from battle damage.

Redid the weight values of the packs and boards to reflect this zone, not CTF. Some ppl will look at this as 
a major nerf. However it was never intended that players be able to circumvent weight restrictions AND gain a
maneuver advantage. A JT should not be able to carry full armor and 6 weapons on a drop pack, for instance.

Added new Item: Stealth Field Generator. Any class can use this. It acts like a stealth coating at the cost of
energy.

Heavy Weapons Troopers can now use partial carapace.

2/14/2002

All stunning weapons are now stand and fire only.
Viral DOT (Damage over Time) damage was boosted a small amount.

2/13/2002

Adjusted weight triggers on PA so walls stop them.
Adjusted SW2002 to not push the target so hard.
Adjusted the Gravitron's radius of effect.
Reduced the energy drain of sensors.
Increased the energy drain of cloak and improved cloak.



2/9/2002

Recalculated the armor values for the secondary armors.
Redid the system for battle damage of utility and secondary armors.

As stated before there are 2 checks performedto see if an item is destroyed. The first check I use to
simulate the potential chance that an item is destroyed in the process of dying. The second check is 
against the items simulated toughness. This essentially the arbitrarily determined resistance to destruction
of the item. A sort of a "saving throw" if you will. A better system would include a modifier from the weapon
that killed the player. Unfortunately we dont have this ability at the present, so we make the best of what is
possible...

Increased all normal and stop weights by 5 kilo's.
Temporarily removed Disruptor.
Temporarily reduced HP back to their pre 1/9 levels except for JT which has 55 HP.

2/4/2002

This is a big update. Expect some things to be tweaked.

Most utilities now have a potential chance to be destroyed and removed from Inventory when you die.
The base chance is 5% that a piece of equipment was damaged. If the check indicates an Item was damaged
there is a 25% chance that it will be completely destroyed and removed from Inventory. If an item is not
destroyed (ie removed) then it is assumed it was repaired. Primary suit armor is uneffected, but secondary
armors (gauntlets/etc.) can be destroyed. No basic equipment items (Items you start with) are effected 
nor are weapons effected (yet muhahahah).

Added new Item: Conversion Generator
Added new Item: Energy Sensors
Added new Item: Enhanced Combat Sensors
Added new Item: Mineral Sensors
Added new Item: Gauntlets

Minerals no longer show up on radar unless you have mineral sensors. This is not so important now
but will be in the future.

Utility slots have been increased to 8.
Walls now require 10 units of titox to create.

PDB's take longer to create. The net end effect is you will be required to stand still longer to 
place them.

Increased ES (Anti Cloak) radius.
Increased SciOps thrust.
Engineers can now use CMP6 and Partial Carapace.



2/1/2002

Walls require 15 titox to make as opposed to 5.
Adjusted VehicleGetInDistance to match ItemPickupDistance, which is 64 pixels.

1/31/2002

Made HP on child vehicles and autoturrets visible to all since there is a bug that precludes team only
display of child vehicle and autoturret HP.
Cloak is disabled on packs/boards
Exoskeleton does not work on packs/boards.

1/30/2002

Adjusted all the structure and wall armours to roughly match the capabilites of the heavier HW and Infantry Weapons.

sensitive weapons like the LAW and the Disruptor.

You now have to sit in place for 4 seconds when you place a blink generator marker.
Adjusted damage rollof amounts for all the plasma weapons.
Added PDB and Wall Kits. Wall limits are 12 per engineer, 36 total per team.

Assist kills are now rewarded 5% of the targets bounty to their bounty.
Base cash reward was raised to 200 credits.
Base EXP reward was raised to 50 points.

1/19/2002

Increased Shotgun pellet inner damage by one point.
Close Combat Shotgun was adjusted to shoot 2 Assault Shotgun blasts as opposed to 2 Shotgun blasts.

Steron Injections now cost 2 units of Pandora to make.

Stim Packs now cost 2 units of Tsolvy to make.

Energizers now cost 2 units of Unilenium to make.

Armour can no longer be dropped. Armour can be sold, however.

********Stats were wiped. This was done because some ppl have inflated stats due to cheats that have been overcome.

1/9/2002

Removed reprogramming kit until a specific parameter is enabled.

Reduced RPG proximity a small amount

CAW now uses 5 energy per shot ( fighting suit powers the weapon)

Made an adjustment to Suit Teleport. When you respawn after death, it takes 20 seconds for the Teleport Locator to re-calibrate.
During this period you will be unable to teleport.  You can still be summoned as normal.

AutoTurrets will give their team 10% of points/cash reward for kills they make. You have to make the kill to get EXP. Sorry. :)

1/4/2002

Increased the inactive time for Shrapnel

Gave the CAW some outer damage.

Decreased the caw's primary firing time.

Increased the primary firing time for all the battle rifles a very small amount.

Primary firing time increased slightly on RPG.

Reload time increased slightly on RPG.

1/1/2002

SMG's inner damage raised to model pistols. Outer damage is still lower than the pistol equiv. This reflects the
the fact that their ammunition is similar.

SMG's alive time is closer to pistols. Again to reflect the fact they use similar ammo.

Stunner is now stand and fire.

The ChangeWeapon timing for stunner and Tranq has been increased.

g9 damage was raised to 30 inner 0 outer.


12/28/2001

G9 sniper rifle has been modified.

When you kill a player, if you kill him again in a short period of time, you will get no cash/exp for the kill.

Pub teams are 12 players, private teams are 10.

12/24/2001

Welcome to "Chaos on EOL"

Exp from bounty has been changed to 5+15% of targets bounty + 5% of your bounty.
Exp is shared in a 320 pixel radius of killing player. Share amount is 25%
