~B~1~PModerator Rules Guidline version 2.21, updated 12 November 2003.

~B~0The following is a list of common offenses that moderators watch for. This is not a perfectly concise list; moderators will use their best judgment from case to case. Remember: Being in this game means you have agreed to the License Agreement presented to you before entering the zone list screen. In accepting those terms, you are subject to its regulations along with any and all in-game rules/regulations (Listed below). It is recommended that you learn these rules, for moderators, super moderators, and SOE Employees expect you to abide by these rules/regulations while playing the game. Thank You.

This list of rules has been divided into two parts: Chat based and Game based. Chat based rules are rules which govern the public chat channels of Infantry/Cosmic Rift. Game based rules are rules which govern the actual play of the Zones of Infantry/Cosmic Rift. Violation of rules listed below may result in punishment determined by moderator present at the time of violation. The consequences for violating the ~B~1Moderator Rules Guidline~B~0 are listed below this list of rules. It is advised that you are aware of these rules, as moderators are not required to issue warnings if deemed unnecessary.
