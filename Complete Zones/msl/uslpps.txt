~B~1USL Penalty Point System~B~2


~BThe point system will work on a 175 point scale. Every player starts out with 0 points (People serving punishments given prior to July 1st, 2007, will still serve those punishments, but will have 0 points in the system). Players gain points with bad behavior, such as racism, hacking, double squadding, staff harassment etc. The severity of the offense will dictate the number of points allocated to the player. 

As a player exhibits bad behavior and gains points, there will be numerous penalties along the way to 175. 

The list of offenses and the points they are worth is below: 

There are obviously times where there needs to be immediate action taken, outside of the point system.

Examples are when there is spam in a match arena... obviously the spammer needs to be silenced immediately. Examples like this is what the Immediate Punishment is for. None of the Immediate Punishments should be completely foreign, they have been used as punishments already for a long time. 
~B
~B~6Spam ~4(5 Points)~B~6 Silence if in match arena. 

~B~6Staff Harassment ~4(10 Points)~B~6 Silence if in match arena. If outside of USL and player does not stop, each instance of harassment after being told to stop will result in another 10 points. 

~B~6Player Harassment ~4(10 Points)~B~6 Only given if occurring during a match. A silence or removal from the arena will be used. 

~B~6Racism ~4(20 Points)~B~6 If in zone, a 120 minute zone ban will be issued. If in #usl chat, each instance of racism after being told to stop will be another 10 points. 

~B~6Double Squadding ~4(75 Points)~B~6 None 

~B~6Hacking ~4(90 Points)~B~6 if caught hacking in a public zone. ~B~4(175 Points)~B~6 if caught hacking in a league. ~B[Zone removal]~B



~B~0NOTE~B: If a player admits to hacking to a staff member and the staff feels there is sufficient proof to warrant a ban, we will do so. 

~B~1IMPORTANT:~B For all offenses, avoidance ~BDOUBLES~B the points for each occurrence. This is not retroactive, meaning if you are punished in week 1 for avoidance, then in week 4, it won't double from week 1. However, it can keep doubling if you are continuing to avoid for the same offense, i.e., you avoid the same ban for the same offense 3 times. ~2

~BPoint System Penalties:~B

~B~050 Points~B~0: 2 week suspension 

~B~075 Points~B~0: 3 week suspension 

~B~090 Points~B~0: Season long ban. If occurring mid-season, the ban will extend into the next season. ex. Nap accumulated 90 points in week 5 of season 10, he would not be able to play until week 5 of season 11. 

~B~0125 Points~B~0: Two season long ban. Same conditions as 90 point. 

~B~0175 Points~B~0: Permanent ban. If a player reaches this point, they have shown themselves to be a complete menace to the league and every effort will be made to keep them from ever participating in the league, including a permanent zone removal. 


~2All referees and USL Staff can "give" you points, however, it will not be official until I go over it and post the points in the thread located in the Staff Mailbox. ~BIf you feel you were given points wrongfully, please contact Flaw or Nap and we will review the incident.~B 

~B~4Point Removal: 15 points will be removed at the end of each season (after champ match).~B
