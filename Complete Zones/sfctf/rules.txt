~B~1Infantry/Cosmic Rift Rules (last updated: November 3, 2009)

~B~0Before playing Infantry or Cosmic Rift, you are presented with a License 
Agreement to which you've agreed to, making you responsible to abide by the 
further elaborated game-specific rules listed in this document. While these 
rules may not cover absolutely everything, they do provide a good grounding 
to the reader as to what is expected of them while enjoying the games.

The rules in the game are enforced by volunteer Trainees (Tmods) and Moderators. 
Outside of enforcing these rules, any Tmod or Moderator may come upon a 
disruptive activity that he/she deems worthy of acting upon. If you have a 
complaint regarding that arbitrary or unwritten intervention, follow
the instructions in the "Moderators List" for how to submit that complaint.
In most cases, Moderators will apply punishment to specific offenses using the 
steps of punishment escalation shown at the bottom of this page. For more 
information on Moderators, see the "Moderators List" in your F1/Help menu.

The following are activities that you are not permitted to do and will be 
moderated:

some effect on your gameplay (e.g., health, rate of fire, speed, weapons,

~1Note(s):
