~B~1 Moderators

Use ?chatadd !911 to reach moderators. Please note that this is not a chat to hang out in
and when asked to do so by moderators, you are to ?chatdrop !911. You can also use the ?help
command, ie "?help Someone is hacking in Combined Arms". Sending pointless ?help's will generally
result in punishment of the individual sending them, so it is not recommended.

~B~1 Guides

Guides are players who are knowledgeable in many aspects of the game who have volunteered their time
to assist new and old players alike with any questions or issues which do not need to be handled by
a moderator. Anyone with questions about gameplay mechanics, settings issues, etc should not hesitate
to ask them.

~B~1 Coders

Coders are the people who make the server run. If you have a bug that is not a zone specific bug,
they are the people to submit it to, either via PM in game, on the forums (found in the weblinks),
or by posting in the Server Development section of the forums. Please note that they are very busy
and bothering them with pointless things that they have no control over ("OH NOES MY FAV GUN/CLASS/
ETC GOT NERFED!!!!") is not only a waste of your time, but theirs, which is extremely valuable.

~B~1 Zone Developers

Zone developers are the guys who created the zone you're playing right now. They are players who have
decided to dedicate their time to creating new content for the game. If you find a bug that is zone
specific, have a question about a particular zone's mechanics, or would like to help test future changes
to a particular zone, contact the appropriate dev. As with coders, they are very busy and bothering
them with trivial matters is not suggested.

~0 Symbolite - Fleet
~0 Skear - Corps Combat/Legacy


~B~1 Other Content Developers


These are the people who provide things like graphics, sounds, etc for Zone Developers to use. They do
not have any control over any zone, and cannot help that your favorite class/weapon/armor was nerfed by
the zone developer.

~B~1 Please note that this list is not NEARLY everyone who has contributed to the continued success of
Infantry over the years. Any omissions are not to be perceived as any type of disrespect, this list is 
only the current team working on the game.
