Thanks to NANX, and NOD for file help. All the testers who have been of great importance and help.
Big shout to Military Police and SatoriEnd for allowing this zone to be made.

After a complete overhaul of the graphics and files (mainly due to massive changes in the way certain aspects of the engine work) 
the zone is now ready to go and give enjoyment to a new era of Hockey Zone fans.

Special mention to VectorBoy and 4U2NV for the creation of the zone back in 2000 and 7hm for his work on it in more recent times.

~BChanges as of 18/8/09 (Mode)~B
- Made some adjustments stop which has solved the issue of players using it to thrust backwards.
-Tried multiple ways to get dive to work, however it just is not possible, the engine adjustments render the old method useless. we will keep trying though.

~BChanges as of 6/4/09 (7hm)~B
- Fixed key bindings so that they are the same for every class.  1 is check / shoot, 2 is pass, 3 is shoot, 4 is other.
- Test of reflex dive using explosion recoil instead of negative weapon recoil, which is limited by natural top speed
- Adjusted back hand to be a drop pass

~BThe Zone~B
So this is the new Infantry Hockey Zone, with updated graphics, rounded style corners, the classic infantry player will love this game.

Please try to make games flow with 1 goalkeeper per team. This is important to allow games to be playable. 

Bench Class change available. So you guys dont have to spec to change class you can go to the bench and change class. This area is not to have pucks taken into. Anybody found taking a puck into the bench area will be subject to a lock out of the game, persistant offenders may recieve further punishment.

~BClasses available~B

~BGoalies:~B
Positional - These goalies are large and bulky and depend on their positioning to make the save.

Reflex - These goalies are small (small for a goalie), very quick and agile. They rely on their dexterity and acrobatic ability to make saves.

~BDefenders:~B
Power - Hard hitting defenceman with a powerful slapshot and clear.

Finesse - Fast moving defenceman who dont have that big a check, but make up for that with speed, skill and play.

~BWingers:~B
Skilled - These are the players who are quick and agile, but not quite to the same degree as the Flashy forward. They have fast skillful abilities to trouble any defence.

Shooting - These players' primary weapon is their blistering slap-shot. They can wind up from anywhere on the ice and goalies will flinch knowing what's coming at them. They tend to be average players in every other physical attribute.

~BForwards:~B
Center - These are the players who just seem to be able to keep the puck on a string. They have superb puck-handling skills and because of this can find the time to either break through the defence for a shot or pass. Most of these players tend to rely on their superb vision to make their plays rather than physical talent alone but they have the ability to lay it out on the line when neccesary to make the play.

Power - These are the big, strong, powerful forwards that will cycle the puck to get their scoring chances. They can take and dish out hits and rely on their heavy shot rather than nimble moves to score goals.

Speed - These are quick, agile players that can burn you with speed, deke defencemen and goalies out of their skates, and generally give the opposing team's coach headaches trying to come up with ways to stop them. They are, however, weak. It doesn't take much to knock them off the puck, and they either cannot, or do not hit (i.e. they're wusses).

Each class has it's own set of shots to make them unique and have the ability to contribute in different ways to a team.

Enjoy the zone and have fun. Any problems please report them to Mode or Military Police.
