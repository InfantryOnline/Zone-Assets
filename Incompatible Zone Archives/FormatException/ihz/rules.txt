~B~1Infantry Online Rules (last updated: June 5th, 2012)

~B~0Before playing Infantry or Cosmic Rift, you are presented with a License 
Agreement to which you've agreed to, making you responsible to abide by the 
further elaborated game-specific rules listed in this document. While these 
rules may not cover absolutely everything, they do provide a good grounding 
to the reader as to what is expected of them while enjoying the games.

The rules in the game are enforced by volunteer Moderators, for more 
information on Moderators, see the "Staff List" in your F1/Help menu.
Please note that the aliases in the Moderator section of the list are
not the moderator's only aliases, and may not even be their main alias.
You'd be ahead to just not violate any of these simple and easy to follow
rules, ever. :)

The following are activities that you are not permitted to do and will be 
moderated:







~B~1Any player found to be engaging in the following gameplay offences will be 
subject to typical or custom punishments as directed:~B



~B~1 ~0Intentionally leaving an arena/game with the intent to avoid 
punishment from a Moderator (e.g., lock, silence, ban, or jail time).~B

~1Example(s):
~0-Typing "?go" or "?quit" after a Moderator silences or locks you.
-Leaving the arena or game because you think a Moderator is about to ban 
you.



~B~1 ~0Using a hack, trainer, exploit, or abuse bugs with the intent to 
cheat in any way.~B

~1Example(s):
~0-Any programs that run while Infantry/Cosmic Rift are running and have 
some effect on your gameplay (e.g., health, rate of fire, speed, weapons, 
etc).
-Map related bugs such as shooting through walls and placing your character 
on physics in order to make your summons randomly warp players to different 
locations on the map (summon bug).
-Using a hack of any kind will result in no warnings or temporary bans, you
will be immediately and permanently banned from the game.



~B~1 ~0Forcing your character to be spectated or disconnected in order to 
avoid death.~B

~1Example(s):
~0-Spamming in chat.
-Pulling connection to create lag or disconnection.



~B~1 ~0Using a secondary "dummy" account. Meaning, having two accounts on 
at the same time and in the same arena.~B

~1Example(s):
~0-Using the second account to find players on the map while your main 
character is in game.
-Using the second account to feed your main character free kills 
(statistics padding).



~B~1 ~0Repeatedly summoning players without permission (also known as 
"Random Summoning").~B

~1Example(s):
~0-Summoning a whole team without consent to help your chances of survival.
-Summoning people into enemy mines and/or weapons fire (this can be seen as 
Statistics Padding or Team Sabotage as well).
-Summoning the same player repeatedly without request.



~B~1 ~0Intentionally sabotaging team efforts, friendly turrets, structures, assets, 
or players on your team (also known as "Team Sabotage", "Team Killing" and "TKing").~B

~1Example(s):
~0-Using a Demolition Pack or Demolition Charge to destroy a team's base 
structures.
-Intentionally firing weapons (ones that deal damage to teammates) at your 
teammates to lower their health points.
-Purposely getting vehicles stuck or moving them out of sight so your team 
does not utilize them.

taking the ball in the wrong direction (ball zones). 



~B~1 ~0Statistics Padding your characters (also known as 
"Stat Padding").~B

~1Example(s):
~0-Feeding (or receiving) kills to (or from) someone in order to increase 
their (or your) bounty, better their (or your) kills to deaths ratio, 
experience, repeated deaths to collect helmets (your own or not), logging 
off your alias to log on another alias to buy supplies for your main alias 
(cash padding), or any other activity with the intent of artificially 
inflating a players score.
-Forcing an unowned flag drop. Being summoned/recalling to the dropship to 
force drop the flag you are holding, switching to Spectator Mode to force 
drop the flag you are holding, or running across terrain known to cause flag 
drops.
-In static flag zones, taking turns capturing a flag repeatedly in 
cooperation with a friend on the opposing team.

~1Exception(s):
~0-It is legal for a player who is leaving the game to give their bounty 
away to a player of their choosing. This is allowed provided the player in 
question leaves the arena and ends their session for the minimum amount of 
time of 30 minutes.

~1Note(s):
~0-Statistics Padding is usually dealt with first by a warning and then a wiping of the character.



~B~1 ~0Playing the game with excessively high lag/latency (intentional or unintentional).~B

~1Example(s):
~0-Flagging in zones where capturing the flag/position is the objective 
while your lag info is above the allowed limit (400ms ping, 4% packet loss 
non-combined, 250 c2s latency) or otherwise visually seen as disruptive by 
a moderator.
-Using file sharing or other such programs to inflate your lag.

~1Note(s):
~0-The abovementioned lag limits do not only apply to flagging. In any zone, 
a moderator that sees your lag as being disruptive to the game may use those 
limits or may base it on a solely visual basis.
-Having higher latency than average ping in any zone may get you removed from playing.








~B~1Any player found to be engaging in the following chat/communication offences will be 
subject to typical or custom punishments as directed:~B



~B~1 ~0Flooding and Spamming.~B

~1Example(s):
~0-Any amount of message flooding that a moderator deems to be disruptive to the chat interface.

~1Note(s):
~0-Spamming offences are typically dealt with first by a warning then a silence. 
Banning will occur if the player avoids the silence or is spamming to force disconnect.




~B~1 ~0Racism~B
~0- Any Racism in the SK Zone will result in (3) warnings. After those (3) warnings are given, a silence will be issued.
There will be a 30 minute ban from the zone if this is avoided.
If they sign back in on another alias and we find out about it, there will be a 1 hour ban from the zone. It will then go up in time everytime they avoid the ban.

2nd Offense: 30 minute ban from zone.
3rd Offense: 60 minute ban from zone.
4th Offense: 3 hour ban from zone.

coordinates.

as long as it's easily verifiable and equally damaging to fair gameplay.

~1Example(s):
~0-False or prank reports.
-Spamming the command.
-Derogatory remarks in ?help requests.

~0-Spamming the !911 chat.
-Derogatory language.
-Refusing to leave the chat without valid reasons for staying.
-Entering and leaving the chat repeatedly.
-Remaining in the chat and impersonating Moderator status to visitors.

~1Note(s):
~0-Proper usage of !911 includes: stating your purpose in the chat as soon 
as you enter, dropping the chat as soon as you are finished (or told to), 
and using the chat for rule violation reports only. For other matters use 
the ?help command.



~B~1 ~0Impersonating a Staff Member for any reason.~B

~1Example(s):
~0-Saying you are a Coder, Developer or Moderator when yu are not.

~B~1 ~0Intentionally misleading players in a manner that is significantly self-destructive.~B

~1Examples:
~0-Telling players that typing "?wipecharacter" will result in some kind of benefit.





~B~1Any player found to be engaging in any activity that a staff member deems significantly inappropriate
but is not listed prior may be subject to typical or custom punishments at their discretion.~B






~B~1Punishments:~B

~1Punishments for violations of the above rules may include, but are not 
limited to, any combination of the following:

Wiping of character(s)
Being silenced
Being locked into Spectator Mode
A temporary zone ban
A temporary game ban
A permanent account ban
Being warned
Being jailed
Any other action the mod staff deems appropriate


~B~1Typical escalation of punishments is as follows:~B


Every player will have a warning before being jailed, wiped, etc (except hackers) for every offense, the
first three (3) times they break the rule in question. Failure to heed the warning will result in 30 minutes 
in jail. After you've violated the same rule more than three times, you will be sent directly to jail. Jail
terrain does not allow switching to spec and has a 30 minute ?quit timer, anyone using Ctrl+Alt+Del and ending
the Infantry process to "escape" jail will have their sentence doubled every time they do it. 30 mins to 60, 60
to 120, 120 to 240 and so on. It quickly becomes not worth it, and you are advised to serve your 30 minutes in
peace, and to use the time to reflect on why you should not ignore the rules and the warnings you were issued
before you were sent there.


Most offenses will follow a typical escalation punishment model, but others may fall under 
specific custom escalations. Moderators may act on occurrences that are not listed here 
and those occurrences will be assessed later to see if it warrants being added to this document.
