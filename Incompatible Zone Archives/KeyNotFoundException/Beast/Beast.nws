Beast Team
~0As the beast your objective is to find and kill all humans.  You can jump higher, run faster, hit harder and take more punishment then any other player.  Avoid large groups of humans, as they will have enough firepower to take you out.  You're invisible on radar, so use stealth to your advantage when attacking large groups.  Your Health will not regenerate and if you fail to kill the humans within the timelimit - you lose.  If you're having trouble finding a human, use your sense heat ability to assist you in finding an enemy through a wall.

~1Human Team
~0Humans get the technological advantage.  Upon game start, immediately find some weapons, food, health and ammo.  Use these to keep your energy and health topped off while you cover and protect your team-mates.  Lone humans die fast, even when armed.  All your enemies are powerful at close range, so shoot them to keep them away, it will also stun and knock the beast back buying you more time.  You only get one life as a human.  Use it well.

~1Spider Team
~0You become a spider after you've died as a human.  You're out of the game and patheticly weak.  However in a large group of spiders you can gangup and take down a human or even a weakened beast.  Good luck.
