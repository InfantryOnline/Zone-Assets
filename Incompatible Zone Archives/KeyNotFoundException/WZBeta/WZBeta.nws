~BWar Zone BETA!~B

This is a variation of WZA.  Basically there are 75 flags on the map, all in defendable positions.  Your objective is to capture and hold as many as possible.  Only Commando's, Engineer's and Squad Leaders can capture flags.  All other classes are there to defend flags and bases.  Every 15 minutes you will be awarded points and cash based upon the number of flags held.  More ppl in the zone, and more flags held = $$

SL, Commando, and Engineer can capture flags.
Increased team turret amount to 10.  Radius 600 pixels, max active in radius is 3...

Took out some vehicles.  Re used some graphics to add spice.. :)
Quality, not quantity.
Added Summoner to APC driver position.
Fixed some odds and ends.

~BMonday July 3rd, 2000~B

Added the "Cadillac"... :))
Made vehicles more scarce.

You can now sell items again for 10% of the purchased price.  The caveat is that if you can sell an item, you cant drop it.. So the only way to get rid of an unwanted item is to sell it.  Some item can be dropped, and not all items can be sold.. Ie ammunition.

As soon as I have graphics made for ammo dispensors, all vehicles will require crew to bring AMMO for the weapons they fire. :)

Changed the vehicle movement models.  You will whine, but it is for the better.

Changed all the spawn points around for players.
Added spawn points for Lepard

Yankee

~BThursday June 8th, 2000~B

Added some robot infantry for you folks to kill.  I have plooped down a platoon in 3 places on the map.. They will periodically reinforce tho.. Keep em killed.. :)  Dunno how long they will stay, more of an experiment actually...

Yankee

~BWednesday June 7th, 2000~B

I have been working on Infantry well over a year now.. :)

New weapon for vehicle drivers.. AP launchers.  Just Shrapnel launchers. Not overtly dangerous.
Engineers Compartment has a repulsor field in it.  All vehicles with an eng Compartment benefit by having an engineer on board.

Yankee

~BTuesday, May16th, 2000~B

Greets!

Enjoy...

~BThursday April 20th, 2000~B

Changed movement model around.  Tops speeds are faster.
SciOps can now use Gauss rifle.
Changed some things around internally.. 
Note on Steron:  the new steron increases your top speed, thrust, and recharge rates.  It only lasts for 60 seconds however.

~BMonday April 17th, 2000~B

updated RR Canister
Update Shotgun.. Got rid of old one and Shotgun M.
Updated Assault Shotgun
Updating the class movement models, and will be switching some weapons around and adding a few new.

~BWednesday March 29th, 2000~B

Reworking the armour model for vehicles.  Some things may seem screwy, please be patient.

Made vehicles a little more rare.  When Bunkers are destroyed it will be a while before they respawn as well..

Yankee

~BTuesday March 28th, 2000 -- ljc~B

Gave the Shotgun (M) even more damage. It's almost ready to replace the old shotgun.
Adjusted all mines. They were actually floating in the air. I'm surprised no one ever noticed this. (Thanks total_newbie for pointing it out.)

~BTuesday March 28th, 2000 -- ljc~B

Removed the gory death animation. It's life in beta testing, it will return later in another zone.

~BSunday March 26th, 2000 -- ljc~B

Added a new death graphic to all classes except SciOps.

~BFriday March 24th, 2000 -- ljc~B

Tweaked the ShotGun (M) some more. This will become the normal shotgun eventually. Made the spread pattern look better and increased the damage per pellet a bit.

~BTuesday March 14th, 2000 -- ljc~B

Fixed a bug that was allowing Skimmers to spawn off the map in the black.

~BSaturday March 11th, 2000~B

Added shrapnel to Frag Grenades, Ap Mines, AT Mines, Recoilless Rifle, and mortar.
Redid the way RR Canister works, should be neat.
Nerfed the tranq a bit.
Wanna see how things turn out before adding some more weapons for a bit. :)
Increased Recharge rate on heavy SLIGHTLY
Increased Energy to 600 and recharge rate on SciOps.

Yankee

~BWednesday March 6th, 2000~B

Hey all..  I overwrote Ljc's "toys" (DUCKING).. Seriously tho, I suck.. :)

Swapped classes around, and added a new class; The SciOps trooper.  Medic is now a BioChem or BC Trooper.  Equipment was moved around a bit, and BC Trooper can still perform medic roles.  You will see how things shook down.. Dont fret, since we have new graphics and such, new weapons are coming REALLY soon.

Final Texturing is done one the APC, and Ambulance, just need to let the box spend the time to render them.
Gunship is coming next, and JT's will be getting a Hver Cycle to scout in VERY soon.

As soon as time permits, I will either add more cover/details to Beta (with Rod's blessing of course.. :)) or Expand KR out.  At any rate, as soon as things get into groove mode,  some new maps should be available here and in CTF.  How is that for suitably vague?

-- MORE

Added Stumm Gas grenade for BC trooper.
Maser is now for SciOps.  I changed it all around.  It should be neater now.. :)
Odds and ends graphically.

BTW Vehicles disappear after 2 seconds when destroyed.. Repair them BEFORE they are dead.. :)

Yankee

~BMonday March 6th, 2000~B

Restored $$ PA
Toughened engineer position.
Increased Kill Cash
Turrets give a small percentage of kill cash. 
Fixed some bugs and  fixed AT Rocket mess.. :)


Look for new vehicles VERY soon.

Yankee

~BWar Zone ALPHA~B is a non flag, fighting only arena using the vehicles, equipments, and Weapons from Infantry:CTF

You begin the game in the Store Satellite, which is the only place you can purchase items/equipment and select Classes (other than in spec mode).

You start with 10,000 credits in cash.

When you die you do not instantly go back to the store zone, instead you randomly re-enter the map.  After you have left the store zone you can only get back by telporting to a teammate or recalling.

You can have private teams in this zone.

I am sure there will be a lot of things to do, but I hope this is enjoyable.

~BTuesday February 28th, 2000 -- Yankee~B

I have changed the items file to disallow selling.  You cannot sell any items after purchase.  If you are changing classes, give away your weapons to needy players.. :)  On the plus side, this allows me to increase the starting cash amount to 10,000.  This is enuf to get armour, or a piece of equipment and a good weapon.

I will be adjusting weapon weights as well.  They need to be adjusted to allow a player to do his role, or be effective, but not carry too many types of weapon. Encumberance concerns should alwys he a key decision when decinding on loadout.

Yankee

~BThursday March 1st, 2000 -- Yankee~B

Adjusted vehicles so that the more ppl in the arena, the more vehicles available.
