The purpose of this zone is for people to download the .blo files for the future release of Chambert's Tournament (the new cm).  There is nothing to do here.  This will save on our monthly bandwidth usage since this zone is using a different server.  Now that you have entered this zone and downloaded the .blo files, you should be one of the first to enter Chambert's Tournament when it is released.  Check back every so often to see if a .blo file has been added or updated.

As far as the future release date of Chambert's Tournament, the date has been moved from soon(tm) to sooner(tm).  When the zone comes up, it will be a preview so the developers can see what the zone looks like with many players in the zone.  Afterwards, the zone will be taken down so the developers will have time to adjust settings.


PS: for all you guys that don't know what (tm) means, it means trademark.
