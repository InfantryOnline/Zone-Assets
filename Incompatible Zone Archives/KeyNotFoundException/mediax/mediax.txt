Welcome to Medieval CTF!

This zone is very unfinished (but still in a playable state, so I thought I'd give people something to look forward to).
There are hardly any experience/cash limitations right now because I need to see how all the weapons/classes interact
with the short time span I have. You have may have noticed there is no armor. Why? Because this gives everyone equally
vulnerable to damage. The only armor available is resistances (and a few short duration spells).

Post your suggestions at www.simfantry.com please, I value everyone's input (and will do my best to respond to everything)
