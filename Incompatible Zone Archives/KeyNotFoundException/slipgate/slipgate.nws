~B Slipgate Zone by warlock ~B

A Quake style zone in a Quake style map. The map looks very queer indeed, with gothic floors and base walls...but besides that its fine and promotes deathmatch gameplay, i guess.

There's a total of i don't know how many weapons. Pick'em up and kill everything that moves. There's portals around the arena ammo for your weapons and the money you get is suposed to be spent in taunts.
My next goal is to make a real Gothic Map, a Base map and a Space map (rotate'em) with jump pads if possible and who knows a CTF map. Also, add some decent quake3 models instead of the crappy pipboy. To do such i'll be needing third party help. Anyway hoep you enjoy it.
