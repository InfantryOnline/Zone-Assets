No one would have believed in the last years of the 20th century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own. . .
Yet across the gulf of space . . . intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.
But who shall dwell in these worlds if they be inhabited? . . . Are we or they Lords of the World? . . . And how are all things made for man?
