However, the process of its installation and use, though highly technical, actually increases the efficiency and effectiveness of a normally weak field, while retaining its compactness.

An interesting piece of technology, it's actually partially alive. SilenTech scientists genetically manipulated some of the symbiotic relationships between Xenomorphs and their armor and were able to create a suit that produces a similar property. In this case, the base of the suit is formed around a nanomesh undercoat that reacts to pressures and heat, being internally flexible, but hardening when exposed to shockwaves, heat or ballistic impacts. The nanomesh is woven with a specially designed metal that causes almost a 'white noise' to sensors from larger distances, though it can be easily seen through at closer ranges. Atop the nanomesh is a set of organic, quasi-symbiotic bioplates that act as both a primary armor and stealth suit that powers itself from the host's body and chloroplasts lining the seams of these plates. Like any symbiote, it also acts to protect its host, repairing damage to both the host and the suit itself, though this heavily reduces the protective properties of the suit as its processes are focused elsewhere. In terms of stealth, it reacts much the same way as a chameleon does but in a much faster and effective manner, given that it adopts no color on its own and can even react to many forms of invisible light. This can prove problematic in combating it, as it retains its chameleon-like properties even while firing, meaning one would have to close enough distance to discern it from the environment, or guess its position from the rather more passive stealth system. Of an interesting note is that while the suit lacks the ability to sustain itself under heavy fire, it is quite adept at *deflecting* force away from it as opposed to absorbing it.",  10000,42000,0,0,0,  0,-1,0,40000,0,  icons,gfx00001,0,0,0,0,0,0,    1,5,37,320,  500,250,0,0,  0,300,0,  0,0,0,0,0,2,  None,None,0,0,  1000,0,3000,0,1000,0,0,0,1000,0,0,200
