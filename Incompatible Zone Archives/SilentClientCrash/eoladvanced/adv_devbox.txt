~2I've removed the older (now irrelevant) entries here and I will continue to do this in future updates so this section has more of a current events feel to it.

Eol is a forever on-going zone in development without a finish line in sight. Even if it ever made it to the point where the engine was being fully utilized, there would still be room for improvements and further polishing. Development for me is an off and on process and with the volume of content with the amount of brainstorming and new ideas, I find myself back and forth between areas just to keep a balance of steadily flowing content. There are some ideas that I've been working on that date back to October and even August that have taken a long time simply because of the need for a way to incorporate it into the zone without jeopardizing, or compromising certain aspects of gameplay and functionality. I'm hoping to have a chunk of that content ready by summer and most of it by the end of the year.

This rotation the zone will only be up for 2 weeks. During 2 week rotations a minimum of 1 update will occur. It will be rare to find an update does not happen. In the event an update does not occur during short rotations for the zone, this simply means I want recent prior updates to stew in order for better feedback. I will aim for another 1 month long rotation period for the zone sometime this year. During 1 month rotation periods there will be a minimum of 2 updates and will be reserved for times when a larger amount of content additions, or changes need to occur. Next time the zone is up, the normal themed map will return. Eol is likely to be up more often in the future, with the next rotation period as early as sometime in April.
