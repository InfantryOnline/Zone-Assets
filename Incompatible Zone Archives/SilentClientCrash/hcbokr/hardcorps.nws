Current Map: Pleasant Valley, Mars

Current Test Mode: Manual Reload Mode

Hiya!

We are trying out a mode of HC where you have to manually reload weapons when you run out of ammo.

The default reload key is the End key, but you can remap it to anything you like, the default fire
button is button 10.

This only applies to weapons that use a clip or magazine or a belt.  The Shotgun has a different magazine
arrangment, as does the sniper rifle, and the Grenage Launcher is single shot.

Assault Rifle has been modified:  It now has 2 fire modes, Burst mode (fire button 1) fires the 3 round
burst, and Full Auto mode, which fires automatically.  Burst mode is more accurate, and Full Auto is subject
to jamming.

Marine no longer has shotgun, this weapon being relegated to other troop types.

Removed Ripper/LMG stand and reload.

PDW has selective fire (single shots or full auto)

Ripper Gun has Sustained and Full Auto modes.

Currently testing a CTF game in HardCorps!

For this game type, there are 2 additional classes:

Sergeant and Engineer.

Sergeant is like the Sqaud Leader, except that the Sergeant can also Warp to another players position.

Sergeant's require 100,000 EXP to play.

Engineer's are a new class that have several new functions:

-At game start all Engineer's are given a Point Defense Sentry.

   PDS units can only be placed once.  There can only be a maximum of 4 within a 1500 pixel radius, and
   there can only be 8 active per team max, and 1 active per Engineer, max.

   PDS units can be destroyed. They can also be repaired.

-At game start all Engineer's will be given 2 Barricades to place.

   Once a Barricade is placed it cannot be moved again.

   Barricades can be destroyed. They can also be repaired.

   Barricades block enemy fire and movement, but do not impede their team.

Engineer's are equipped with an Enercell and a Repair Kit.

   The repair kit requires the user to select what is going to be repaired and
   requires the user to be within 64 pixels of the object to be repaired.
