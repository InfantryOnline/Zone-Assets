~B~5FLAGS AND BASES~5~B

Titan Militia will begin their assault from the Northwest of the map. Collective Military will deploy their defense from the Southeast of the map.

The East and West bases have stationary flags which can not be moved. The South base contains a mobile flag for capture. Your team will want to bring the South flag to your base and assault the opposing team's base.

Build turrets and keep a few to guard your main base, while having an offense to assault and holding the enemy base for 60 seconds to win.

~BCollective & Titan History~B

It's been a decade and the war between the government (Collective Military) and  the Titan colonies (Titan Milita) still wages on today. 


The Collective is a pure democracy; every single citizen has a voting unit in which they vote on every issue, although more often only on the issues that concern them. 

The Titan rebels are mainly located in the outer colonies of the solar system and are a minority compared to the much larger populations of Earth and Mars. 
The rebels feel their colonies are being exploited for resources and labor due to the fact that they have little voice on what is decided. 

The citizens of the larger populations cannot understand why people would rebel from a system where everyone has a say and thus the war. Titan has the largest population of the outer rim colonies and therefore the major battles are between them and the Collective Military.
