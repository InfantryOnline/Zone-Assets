~B~21.06~B - The Home Team will be able to select the side of the map that they want to play from for the first game. For the second game the sides will be reversed. If a third game is necessary the sides will revert back to the original sides from the first game. Thus, Home Teams do attain a slight "Home Team Advantage".
~0
~B~21.07~B - At game time a 5 minute timer will be started. During this time captains should contact the referee and provide the referee with their starting line up. When this timer reaches 0 the game will begin.

~0
~B~21.09~B - Any player that purposely abuses the incorrect visional or physical physics of the map will be removed from that game with no substitute allowed; based completely on the referees discretion. Physics abuse includes, but is not limited to, firing through a wall and firing at a wall with the intention of damaging a player on the other side. If a player is worried about doing this accidentally than he should consult the referee before the game on what is illegal. Note: Ignorance is not a valid excuse.

~B~21.10~B - ~B~4(Not in use)~B~0 ~2TT rule: This rule applies only to the southern flag within the armoury (computer room) on the OS map, the objective 'a' cavern on the CavernSL map, and to no other flags. If a team has half or more of their current team (slots) within the computer room for over 1 minute, the referee will start a "Turtle Timer". The Turtle Timer (TT) will be a count down from 5 minutes, at which time anyone from the turtling squad that is left within that room will be spectated; losing their team slot and allowing for no substitute. The TT will be stopped and withdrawn if the room becomes void of all players from the squad in question at any time. On the OS map, the armoury is defined as any area inside that building to the right of the armoury door. On the CavernSL map, the object 'a' cavern is defined as the both the west and south long entrances into the cavern and the cavern itself.

~0
~B~22.07~B - If a restricted class (Medic or Sniper) loses their game slot for any reason, the number of players allowed as that class on that team will be reduced by 1 (e.g. If a sniper dies out and then a marine lags out with more than 1 life remaining, the substitute for that marine cannot go in as a sniper because that team has a class restriction of 0 snipers given by this formula: [previous class restriction] - [# of games slots lost when using that class] = [current restriction]).

~0
~B~25.05~B - Any lag that is below -5.0% packet loss will be treated in the same manner as packetloss above +5.0%
~0

~B~217.04~B - The only people that are authorized to postpone games are the League Moderators, League Administrator, and current game Referees.

On top of the reasons described in rule ~B17.04~B, another reason for why the start of a game may be postponed is if the previous game of the same match was conducted in err and needs to be replayed. The only people authorized to delay the start of a game in this manner are Schedulers, Head Referees, League Moderators, League Administrator, and current game Referees. If, at the end of thirty minutes, it has been decided to replay the previous game, the delayed game may be delayed longer still to accomodate the replaying of the previous game; alternatively, it may be postponed entirely due to time constraints. If, however, at the end of thirty minutes, the delayed game still has not started, but no game replay is being required, or the game replay being discussed has not yet been decided upon, the delayed game must either be played immediately, or postponed in exact accordance with rule ~B17.04~B.

If you are not satisfied with the response and you feel that your appeal was dealt with unjustly or that your situation was over-looked, you can request (via your captain) to the League Moderator that the appeal is taken to the League Administrator for a final review.
~0
~B~218.03~B - If there is any other SL occurance that does not fall under Rules ~B18.01~B and ~B18.02~B which you legitimately feel requires redemptive or consequential action you may request your squad captain to report an appeal to a League Moderator. The report should include all of the relevant information in as much detail as you can provide.
~0
~B~218.04~B - If it is the case in which you would like to appeal an incident but you are not part of a squad that is active in the current season of SL, you may appeal directly to the SL Official who would have received your appeal from your captain if you had been apart of an active squad. However, you must state that you are not active in the current season of SL and thus have no squad captain clearly on your appeal.

The times should be listed from 1-3, in order that the squads would like to play those times (1 being the time the squad would like the most, 3 being the least).
