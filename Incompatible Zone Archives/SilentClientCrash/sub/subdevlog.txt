Some of these updates are odd.  Blame STAS.  This entire zone and your addiction is all his fault!
Set TD vehicle's HP so they can be seen by all
Add outdoor walls
Removed cat code from lag armor 
Set PrizeBountyPoints on "bounty" to 100 instead of 1.
Removed PDB, Factories, HQ, and Encasement fields from indoors because their graphic was too big.
Flamethrower residue hits friendlies now
Added vehicle factory back in.  We are testing.  Let's see how it can be abused
Removed the logic on workbenches, factories, etc which restricted them to just engineers.  
HQ is now droppable
Adjusted the bounty rate.  Let's see how many kills it takes to get to 30K

Fixed Twin Laser to bounce off walls once
Messed around with Hedgehogs, Vector Fields and Vortex Suction, no clue what will happen.
Bunkers don't stop AutoGun fire... pretended to attempt to fix that... :\

removed the physics from the HQ in the DMZ
Put the new wall graphics on the concrete walls

Set the steron injector projectile's lifetime back to the previous value.  This thing should be done now
Fixed the HMG not reloading.  Kept the broiler the same.
Put together a tractor turret
The sentry shouldn't go off around staff now
Summoner is now stand and fire
Staff dismantle shouldn't trigger on people now.   Oh that was fun while it lasted
Set the "flags" back to "turds"
Set some of the shrap back to normal now that the "shrap bug" is fixed.  Look for any shrap which looks suspicious.
Adjusted the vector graphic again.  No setting changes though
Improved the ultrablack again
Redid the .cfg so it would set the prizebountymultiplier.  Let's see if it updates this time.
Adjust some warps until ryan can look at the lio
Attempted a new arty shield graphic
Added marine's new graphic to a few base items

Tested the problem with the steron injector and fixed it.  Note to other devs: The projectile has 
 to actually do damage.  I set the projectile to .1 and .1 bypass and it works like a charm even 
 if you have armor to protect all damage from bypass.
Players can now see the HP on the vehicle fabs
Adjusted vector again to see if that silly graphic will show.  It probably still won't work
 until we set it back to the original setting
The tank and arty fabs can't be built indoors
Set some elevation angles on thor and heim.  Let's see what problems that causes.
Adjusted the auto cannons to use the 33.5 damage penetrator instead of the 100.
Added Marine's alterations to the beam shield.  It's so pretty... so hypnotising.... oh I feel so wonderful

Fixed the tank fab glitch.  They should be droppable now too.
Fixed the hq not prizing the encasement field when purchased from the HQ.
Adjusted the encasement field's animation time to 300 so it doesn't look like a working fleshlight.
Set the encasement field to walk through by team but not fire through.
Adjusted the steron injector.
Added Steron Injector (Personal).  Someone else (like ryan) add some neato sounds to this.
Made the fab kits droppable.
Took away the "oops" on the purifier.
Tried an adjustment to the encasement field to prevent it from blinking.
Set skill logic on sterons (oops).  This thing seems a little bit buggy.  I'm not sure how it works.  
 Perhaps it calculates the hit servers side and that is what determines if the projectile actually hits.
Reduced the lifetime on the injector.  Maybe that will help make the hits more likely if this is server side.
Also set to 1 energy drain in case you need to "damage" the target.
Changed the flag graphic again.  One can't go wrong with ctf graphics for flags.
Toyed with the razorwire graphic again.
Adjusted cloaks per stas
...
Made the vehicle fabs equivalent in armor to a wall
You can drop the encasement field now
Restored the fire delay other to jump boots
Sent in the blob for the graphics updates.  DOH
Changed the razorwire's hue

Fixed the refinery being set at 0
The graphic for the vector won't show for others without changing the projectile.  I'll let diety stas do that
Removed the graphic for the DS wp and DS hq
Set the steron injector to trigger on everyone and removed the damage it does
Renamed 1 bounty to Bounty
Adjusted the animation time on the kunai graphic
Redid razorwire to add more detail
Worked on the steron injector.  It fires in DS now.  Sterons will be 5% for 60 sec and 5kg until we see the soon to be abuse.
Fixed the green color of the beam walls back to the original color.  Yes, they need work
Added razorwire 2x graphic
Renamed energy spheres to objectives and gave them a new graphic
Set PrizeBountyMultiplier to 1 for all terrain
Trying the vector a new way per stas so if it doesn't work, die like a man

I don't know why the news keeps getting deleted but let's add some updates
Added tons of new graphics.  I'm always proud of graphics custom made for the zone.  
I made these ones myself.  We have new beam walls (I'll let stas adjust the paramters later), 
a new arty shield graphic (which needs work), beam shield now "glows", new razor wire which matches
the physics of the vehicles, and a new warp point graphic.
Changed all projectiles' PreventPointBlank value to 0 (most likely fix to the "shrap bug")
Set the Icon for all items without icons to Icons,gfx00008 using the database. (God I love this database)
Set the staff dismantle to fire in the DS.  Hopefully this will stay this time.
Added Headquarters to the workbench
Fixed the problem with stimpacks and the HQ
I can't get the graphic to work right with vector shields.  Devs, you can see how I did it by prizing vector shield proj
and trident vector proj
(update to the above.  I got it to work.  A projectile must have a velocity for it to use rotation points)
Improved the Ultrablack
Beefed the flesh light by .5 inner electronic damage
Tried a new take ownership logic for the WP.  If it works, we should apply to the veh pads
Fixed the WP so it can't be built in DS
Added the Steron Injector yet again
Removed the beam explosion from the HQ
Put some sensors on the spec vehicle
Updated the graphics for the throwing knife and added an icon for it.  It's giving me a boner just looking at it.
Put a timer on the recall pack so it won't crash the client

~2~4June 01, 2009~2 ~b

Fixed up the warp point and added a warp to it from DS along with the warp item previously used
Added a warp to the mosh pit (A switch and door still needs added.  I will wait until the map develops even further.)
Create a new graphic from scratch for the Kunai
Added a warp for the HQ which we can test later
Moved the Market Recall warp to land on the safe zone/nuclear bomb shelter
Created a graphic for vectors

Added events to reprize ammo/laws/nades for Preset Classes
Demolitions renamed to Demolitionist
Added descriptions (took from RPG)
Increased physics radius on factories by 10
Assigned vehicles to produce computers. (set in lio, as well)

For ITM,
Vector now adds energy cells to affected teammates/enemies (everyone but 
self)
This will reward teammates using vector simultaneously
Fixed remaining skill logic errors for Preset Classes
KPS Teleport Summoner renamed to KPS T-Summoner
KPS T-Summoner takes 300 energy cells to fire
Set key preferences for some items (kps mainly)
Kick now has 500% inherit momentum (testing :P)
Hedgehog Grenade added to the store, added projectile resistance.
Set all shrapnel projectiles to -99 floor bounce (this should fix the Roach 
bug)
ULF Recall Pack set to 0 buy until it can be fixed
Standardized vector field (tank/man are the same), it is now innate
Longrange RPG arc is 4 (7 before)
Ry-Tek Ar4 UGL arc is 10 (15 before)
Hoverboard slash now works like it used to in WZA:UC
Kunai stun increased to 150 (100 before)

Fixed the Laser pistol quantity on field medic (it wasn't firing)

For LIO,
Produce computers for vehicle pads added
APC Recall warp group added (group:300, id:301)
