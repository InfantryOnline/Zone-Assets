~b~0A breakdown of each division and each class is below:~0~b

~b~1Air Division

~b~4Ambusher --> Skirmisher --> Jump Trooper --> Assault Trooper~1~b

~b~3Ambushers : This Unit specialise in concealing and ambushing enemy. 
Highely effective and capable of inflicting good damage.

Skirmishers : Skirmishers are infantry stationed ahead or alongside of a 
larger body of friendly troops. They are usually placed in a skirmish line to 
either harass enemy troops or to protect their own troops from similar attacks by 
the enemy. Skirmishers are generally lightly armoured for increased battlefield 
mobility and are usually armed with ranged weapons to attack the enemy from a distance.

Jump Troopers : The jumptroopers were an air-to-ground attack unit that were trained 
to engage in airborne, entrenched or otherwise inaccessible enemies. 
They were also trained in the use of hit-and-run attacks where they ambushed the 
enemy from above and often provided other classes with air cover during pitched battles.

Assault Troopers : The ultimate in air assault, these guys know how to get in, 
hit hard and get out. Not great at stand and fight, but hit and run is never 
out of the issue.~b

machine guns as well as a superior range of heavy weapons.
