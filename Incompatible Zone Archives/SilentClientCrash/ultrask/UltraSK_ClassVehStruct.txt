Ultra Skirmish is designed as a team game where building up a base is your main objective.  While the sheer amount of options might lead to some initial confusion, the design of the class / base structure is not all that complex.  

Essentially there are 3 "stages" of base growth, and these stages mirror the classes that you have available at your disposal.  

A simple graph demonstrates the growth of a base:

      Mass Converter (STAGE 1)
	     |
 Parent-Stream Structures (STAGE 2)
	     |
  Output Structures (Stage 3)

You can learn more about each structure in the Structure Information Guide, but as a quick run down, the Mass Converter is the headquarters of your base and is the control building that is required for all other structures.  The Parent-Stream Structures are the second tier of buildings... they don't offer a lot of cool stuff on their own, but you can build the third tier of buildings with these bases.  The Output Structures are the third tier of buildings, and include all the buildings that allow you to build stuff - tanks, train to be a new class, buy items, etc.  Pretty simple when presented like this, isn't it?

There are also a couple other buildings such as the soda Storage Facility and the Drop Portal Store / Academy that don't really fit into this structure map.

Below is a listing of the classes in Ultra Skirmish as well as where you can train as said class and a small description.  This is by no means a definitive list, merely the more common classes found in this zone.  There are also "hidden" classes that are obtainable by building certain structures, having certain equipment, or fulfilling certain objectives.  And new classes will be added where appropriate.

Classes correspond to base development and can be described as STAGE 1,2,3 or Hidden.  The stage corresponds to the level of structures that a team needs to have before players can train as that class.  Higher stage classes normally cost more. Hidden classes have other requirements than just the overall development of your team's base.
