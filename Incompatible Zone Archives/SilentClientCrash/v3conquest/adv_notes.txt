Eol Advanced: Revision

5/10/10

Changed some settings for the flag game and set it to reset every 7 hours.

Imposed minimum range for the two side bolts of the Plasma Projector.

Removed the ability for Disruptor to trigger on non-player made obstacles such as map objects/walls. Set it to allow triggering on board type vehicles. It will still trigger on player made walls and structures if you are still looking to combo it against a player.

Alotted Burn effect to Exosuit Incinerator.

Corrected a bounty exploit.

Removed given bounty from pirate helmets. Credits and alien trophies still provide bounty increments; minus areas that have credit bounty disabled such as the training area.

Doubled experience rewards on helmet-type drops for pirates and aliens.

Dropped BioLabs GP6 access from NeuroTAC.

Testing an assist mechanism for players killing NPCs. This effect is a minimal reward and is only implemented for the newb area. The effective radius for this is twice the size of the shared player kills assist experience for reference. You should also be aware that it may not trigger all the time, even if you believe to be close enough to earn it. If successful enough, this will take root elsewhere, although that will depend on what all happens in closed tests.

Added Roamers Eta, Theta and Iota.




4/23/10

Changed the version/name of the current map to prevent against the redownloading of it. Although, I cannot attest to this fixing the problem altogether as it may still persist in the future.

Experience sharing amounts are quadrupled and will remain as the new experience sharing standard.

Removed Large Stim Packs and Large Energizers from the store. They can still be sold via the ?sell command.

Fixed Artificed Reactic Full weight.

Flag game has changed and will reset every 8 hours. Also changed how frequently difficult-to-break (C3/N3) bases spawn their Majors by cutting the odds appearing in half. This may result in some resets allowing all of those less frequent flags to appear, or none of them.

Made some changes to movement speeds for Field Surgeon, Heavy Weapons and MPAC. Field Surgeon is now on par with Infantry, but the use of certain items such as steron still present a perhaps 'more than necessary' speed advantage.




4/21/10

Regular map is back, tweaked for optimal frames and cleaned up areas as usual. Changed south entrance in C3 to a switch controlled door. Same for north entrance at F9 and also closed the east doorway to the flag room in F9. The switch controlled doors have a 5 second delay between opening and closing during which, the controls are locked from status changing to open or closed. They do not automatically close on their own.

Turned off the Valentine's Day rewards and brought them back to normal. (Koth +30 minutes, -50 cash)

Increased range on the Kamenev PlasmaMG32 and decreased the energy cost per shot by -5 kJ.

Limited the amount of inventory slots you can have for stims/gizers. You can have the maximum carry amount for 4 items. (Not limited to the order of the following) Ex: 2 small stims, 2 small gizers, 2 medium stims, 2 large gizers. Take note that trying to purchase additional items beyond the inventory limit (of 4 slots) will result in waste of cash and attempting to pick up additional items pertaining to this limit will result in waste of item.

Reduced the amount of time Dizziness will effect a player by -3 seconds.

Increased energy regeneration rate on Combat Tech and Engineer +2.5kJ/s. Which is now on par with Chief Engineer's energy regeneration rate.

Changed spawn area for unattached base teleport charges.

Unlinked the projectiles on Plasma Projector and increased the energy per shot to 60.

Increased Kamenev ap mk2 d ammo clip size to 15.

Added Reactic armors. (Armor-Hard)

Added ability for WTF Pirates to migrate and spawn in a couple different areas. This is an initial test.




2/4/10

Changed the map to a winter-themed version. Not completely to my satisfaction, but it will do the trick for now. Please note that although the trees appear bare, the majority of them still retain LOS blocking properties so you can still use them to conceal yourself. Double check with ?showvision.

Valentine's Day is right around the corner and since by the time it is upon us the zone will be taken down within a few days or less in accordance with normal 2 week rotation periods, I've decided to lower the wait time on Koth by 30 minutes and increase normal cash fixed reward amount on kills by +50. This will last for the remainder of this rotation. Use the extra rewards to buy additional ammo, additional attributes, aid your team, or drop some credits for your BFF. :D

Reduced the amount of schrapnel in Mine - Schrapnel. I will adjust this as needed.

Removed experience barrier on Maser Kits for Engineers / Chief Engineers and dropped the buy and sell prices. Reduced the radius it needs to be within in order to be functional/built by 25%.

Added a Burn effect to Maklov Flamethrower, Maklov Heavy Flamer, Grenade - Incendiary, Grenade - White Phosphorous and Titan Arms AP9 Acid Projector. For the grenades, you'll have to make sure the explosion is more inner if the effect is to occur. If the explosion radius is barely hitting players in most respects, it is unlikely the burn will take effect.

Changed permissions on GL weapons and secondaries to allow them to be used on Drop Packs, Jump Packs, Deathboards, Hoverboards and Shimmerboards. Also temporarily changed classid of Flight Packs to mimic Drop Packs and Jump Packs so you can use a wider variety of weapons and items on them until I have time to revamp classids and permissions again. This change allows things like Battle Rifles, Assault Rifles, Blast Weapons as well as Cloaks and Medkits (gears strictly related to classes) to be used while on Flight Packs. If you are wondering what you can use on a Flight Pack or any personal vehicle with your current class and attributes, just get on one and browse the store. Working combinations of items accessible through your own class and attributes will not be redded out. Changed some permissions on a couple heavier weapons so they cannot be used on Flight Packs.

Changed the area and team maxes for auto turrets around. This should mean they have become more flexible in creation whereas a specific order isn't necessary in creating a base. I tested this months ago now, and although I recall the results were positive, if they turn out to be exploitive I will retweak as early as Monday.

Removed the ability to use actuators on packs, save Vehicle Actuators. You can still use normal actuators with boards.

Added Vehicle Actuators II meant for packs providing increased strafe and Vehicle Actuators III meant for both packs and boards providing increased maneuverability. You cannot use more than one Vehicle Actuator at a time, nor in combination with normal type actuators. (Equipment-Fighting Suit)

Reduced Field Surgeon top speed a small amount.




10/27/09

Improved some frame rates in a few areas and corrected some glitchy looking spots. Closed the C3 building up and moved the flag to the back.

Changed several carry-type flag properties to encompass additional terrains accessible through the use of personal vehicles.

Took measures versus a player-reported glitch in Landnaut passenger seats regarding injection creation.

Changed recrowning back to 2 kills.

Trimmed ignore vehicle armors a small amount across all Landnauts.

Increased healing times on Range Heals. Increased the amount of energy it costs to use Range Heals and increased healing amounts on them a small amount. Decreased the healing radius by 1/3. Increased a few of the Area Heals healing times a small amount. Range Heal -Advanced is now known as Range Heal -Enhanced. Gave Medics access to Range Heal -Enhanced.

Added Range Heal -Improved and Range Heal -Superior for Field Surgeons. Range Heals are the only heals that heal both teammates and the player initiating the heal. (Equipment-Medical)

Maser Kits sellback set to the same as the buy price. Don't waste time with them right now since they are disabled. Just sell them if you still have them. Expect them next rotation with some form of precautionary measures in place.

Base Teleport Points are now droppable so you can buy them for your team's Engineer.

Gave weight to credit item makers comparable to the weight of cotton fiber banknotes of 100 denomination.

Added Kamenev GL mk IV for Jump Trooper and Drop Trooper. (Weapons-Fire Support)

Added Kamenev GL Proximity Grenade for Jump Trooper and Drop Trooper. The Proximity Grenade works like a GL-distributed mine. (Ammo-Special)

Increased AR Secondary ammos to fire 3 times before reloading instead of 2. Carrying amount is still the same.

Increased the ROF on Unittech Tech 09 SMG, Unittech Tech 09 SMG (2) and Steiner SMG 10a by 10-20%. Gave Unittech Tech 09 SMG access back to SciOps.

Schrapnel Mines are now restricted to Infantry, Jump Trooper, Heavy Weapons and MPAC only. Will do some nerfing to it later at which point, it may become available again to other classes.




10/15/09

Reduced minimum player amounts for Koth games to 25. Reduced the amount of kills to get a crown down to 1. Will try this for a while, go hunt!

Trimmed AeP5 inner drain by 1/3 of what it was.

Increased experience on Alien 'Helmet' type drops by 15.

Reduced Reprogramming Chip buy price to 1/10 of what it was.

Started setting Cash/Exp rewards back to original values. Then I decided that half of the increase amounts could stay, so consider these settings the new norm for kill rewards. Adjusted newbie punishment to reflect these changes.

Dropped Gamma Heal Tsolvy costs from 10 to 6. Removed minimum range on it.

Added a WTF Pirate spawn at a set location. Spawns a tad over every hour. Several players will need to be playing for this spawn to occur. Will likely migrate locations in the future.

Kenalog protections changed. Teeters on small plasma protections with chemical, psychic and small drain protections. Speed increases were reduced to below steron levels. Gained a small energy regeneration rate increase. Also changed colors on the injections part of the item graphics.

Dropped Bio Stab access from NeuroTAC. Gave it a small DOT beef.

Added Neuro Destabilizers: ST3, KE5 and BK10 for NeuroTAC. (Weapons-Energy)

Allotted a 'burn' symptom to SunSpot and a 'dizziness' symptom to MoonSpot. Burn lowers your plasma and chemical protections a small amount over around 30 seconds and Dizziness reverses rotational points for about 7-8 seconds. This only occurs if a player comes into contact with, or during the explosion of the projectile radius.

Restored Hustlin Harry vehicle salesman at 65 players ingame. Did some necessary permission requirement changes to various vehicles and purchases. Will reverse VPPC and Factory player/server roles and restore them some other time. Do not expect SK type vehicles, I have not decided what to do with them yet.

Reduced NeuroTAC maneuverability speeds. Not by a lot.

Changed NeuroTAC and BioChem innate protections. BioChem gained a small shield drain innate; Chemical and Psychic innates trimmed. NeuroTAC Chemical innate decreased, Psychic protection innate increased.




10/5/09

Corrected the physics height glitches. Darnedest thing that it happened and I think I know what caused it so I'll continue to monitor that.

To make it up to you, I've turned up fixed (guaranteed amount) rewards on the following: Cash (x2) and Exp (x1.5) until next update since this undoubtably interrupted at least one person's gametime. Just a reminder that fixed rewards that are listed for increase do not include the percentage rewards. I left those as they were. I'll try to hold off on an update so you can enjoy this change.

Lowered armor ignores on Base Teleport Point and changed some vehicle properties on it and various other computer-vehicles. AT Turrets now only track vehicles, boards and higher. Their weapons still trigger against players, but don't track them.

Dropped debilitating effect from AeP5.

Gave Captains access to Kuchler PR209g and Maklov mk IV PR.

Gave SciOps access to Unittech Tech 07m PSMG (2).

Gave Sergeants access to Unittech 9mm PDW.

Changed some lio settings.

Adjusted Lieutenant and Captain Summoners. Dropped energy cost on them and reduced the radius area a team member would be warped to when summoned. Also lowered the reload on them.

Gave Captains a small innate shield drain protection.

Made Credit items accessible on majority of the terrains.

Increased Personal Aid Kit -Superior's heal amount a tad. Adjusted Area Heals to be more congruent with the Personal Aid Kits. All Area Heals now cost (2) Tsolvy instead of the progressive 1, 2, 2, 3. Modified the healing times on them a small amount. Also put the healing amounts on par with Personal Aid Kits and changed the energy costs in the same fashion.

Adjusted Berserker properties. Reduced protections in half and reduced the negative energy regeneration by 10kJ/s. Trimmed its lifetime a tad.

Increased all Pirate Helmet experience rewards by 10-20.




10/1/09

Using a Fall-themed version of the map. Redid N3 buildings.

Revamped majority of the weapon/item terrain properties. [Most] everything should work on Dangerous terrain, such as summoners (along with most weapons and craft items) and most vertical thrusting units should work while hovering over the lava terrains.

Area Heals no longer heal the player initiating the heal. Only teammates will recieve the heal. (To be elaborated on later)

Added Personal Aid Kit -Enhanced, -Improved, -Superior for Medic, Biochem, Surgeon and NeuroTAC. All Personal Aid Kits require (2) Tsolvy per heal. Heal times slightly increased across all of these tiers compared to the original settings.

Changed the friction settings on Demolition Charge (and Light) so players can rep them, however this change requires more than one rep used cooperatively in order to significantly move these charges away from their point of placement. Synchronized repping should do the trick.

Lowered Technical requirement on NeuroTAC to 5.

Raised Credit items carry limit (soft) to 2 each.

Removed sell prices on Resources. Gave sell prices to Materials (Titanium Alloy, Energy Core), Injections (Steron, Kenalog, Berserker) and all Stims/Energizers. These sell prices are comparable to 10% of the current Resource 'buy' prices added on by the amount you would need for conversion (to Materials), or for crafting (Energizers, Stim Packs, Injections). If it takes 5 Titanium to convert into a single Titanium Alloy, then a single alloy is worth 50% of Titanium's store buy price. If an Injection requires 2 Pandora to craft, then the sellback is 20% of it's current buy price. For any item not conveniently listed in the store, thus removing easy access to the sell button, use the ?sell command. Lowered prices on Energizer/Stim Pack store item purchases.

Added Public Field Converters. One is located in the inner-NW portion of the DropShip. Another is located in the SW portion of the On-Site Store. Public Field Converters can be used by any player as long as you have the required resources for conversion and 1 Commerce to interact with it. These do bulk loads and due to the amount it is converting at a time, the create time is regulated via longer wait period. The amounts are as follows: 50 Titanium converts into 10 Titanium Alloy, 20 Unilennium converts into 10 Energy Core and 250 Scrap converts into 10 Titanium Alloy. This is available to players for two reasons. 1) the changes to the way materials are used and how they can be profited from. 2) more cooperation between team members to keep a base going.

Gave Conscript access to Titan Arms BR01 and Titan Arms AR 2mv.

Gave Energizer Kit and Light Field Converter (along with the necessary permission requirements for it) to SciOps.

Dropship is now a safe zone. This change will affect your ability to create personal vehicles via craft items. Added Personal Vehicle Vendors. One is located in the inner-NE portion of the DropShip. Another is located in the center-south portion of the On-site Store. Personal Vehicles, upon purchasing from these vendors, will automatically force you to occupy them at no energy cost to you for vehicle creation. Works the same as the VPPC did. Same fees on these as they are listed in the zone store. The option to build personal vehicles via craft items will still remain available to you. This change also affects Koth timers and the ability to be summoned out of the dropship.

Added another portal in the dropship called Safe Warp. Safe Warp is located right next to the Newbie Area portal and you can use it as an alternative to the set warp points via other portals located in the dropship. The portal attempts to put you in a safe location, away from players. This does not, however, consider hostile NPCs and turrets while putting you in that location, so beware. For players with less than 10,000 current experience and less than 5 Deftness, 5 Strength and 5 Vehicle attributes you can get a free trip to your base, if your team happens to have a Base Teleport Point.

Added Base Teleport Points for Tech, Engineer and Chief Engineer. These work like any other structure, or turret/wall. Slot and craft. This creates a type of beacon that other players are able to warp to. Base Teleport Points are crafted for indoor use. They're currently not hooked up to any FCUs, so you can use them on the fly. These will help with taking/defending bases as you'll be able to regroup more efficiently. Since these aren't restricted (which may, or will change in the future), you're encouraged to use them as anchors if you're assaulting a base.

Added Teleport Charge - Base for all classes. Requires 4 Technical and can warp you to your team's base if you have one. If you don't have one, it will random warp you likely to the center map areas.

Added TC - Base Kit for Chief Engineer and Captains for crafting Teleport Charge - Base.

Gave Bio Stab access to Biochem.

Added Titan Arms LMG 2mv for Heavy Weapons and Marine. (For some variety; Weapons-Projectile)

Added Kamenev MG 55G (move and fire) for MPAC. (Weapons-Cannon/MG)

Added ChemTech AeP5 for NeuroTAC. (Weapons-Projectors)

Added Sci-Utility Harness for SciOps. (Equipment-Fighting Suit)

Increased Sergeant maneuverability a tad.

Decreased reliability misfires across all SMGs to 33% of what they were.

Reduced Suit Teleport System and Teleport Charge - Random requirements to 3 Technical.




8/3/09  (7/16/09; 7/30/09)

Added extra measures versus warping/summoning situtations for Conscripts.

Adjusted some Berserker Mode properties so they won't be active while inside vehicles.

Corrected some map errors.

Changed Kuchler LMG ammo use type to 7.7mm.

Increased sellback prices on BlastTech weapons.

Set energy amount upon unspec in line with the amount required to change teams.

Turned store credit items into credit makers. You can carry as many as you want, but they're restricted in the way injections are so you can only use them if you only have one instead of multiples of the same. This regulates the frequency of monetary transfers. These are non-droppable and you can only use them indoors, or the dropship.

Removed psychic/mental damage on Bio Stab; beefed inner chemical/toxin damage a small amount.

Adjusted Reprogramming Kit/Chip radius settings. It's still a small radius, requiring you to center yourself on the turret origin in order to use it properly and take control. Same prefire/still times still apply.




7/8/09

Continuing to bring back post-rollback settings. Post-rollback settings being reimplemented in the coming updates will no longer be noted here, only when an aspect of that gameplay is significantly overhauled.
Side note: Although the UFG nerf that occured 12/17/08 was reimplemented in the 6/30/09 rollback update players are insisting that the "renerf" still occur. It was already nerfed as previously stated in this note. Damage on Kinetic inner/outer stats for UFG during the launch of EolA (during 5/1/2008) were 12/5 which was later (as-stated) reduced in December to 9/2.

Started taking measures versus some of the warping/summoning situations for Conscripts.

Redid portions of the NZ in support of former-said alterations.

Bumped Koth back down to the original 2 hour delay.

Increased experience payout on Koth games a small amount. Reduced Point and Cash payout, however.

Did some additional nerfing to the Assassinate innate weapon (inner drain decreased). The other portion of the nerf was started last update, as you've probably already discovered the difference in the way the reload is being handled. Additionally, trimmed the proximity and blast radiuses.

Reduced the 20 second delay imposed on players with Teleport Charges in their inventory directly after respawning from death to 10 seconds.

Reduced the 10 second delay imposed on players after a "lock-on error" occurs while using Teleport Charges to a 5 second delay until you can attempt again.

Teleport Charge - Unit weapon switch delay reduced from 5 seconds to 3.5 seconds.

Gave Racom GP103c to SciOps.

Removed ability to use Stroker from personal vehicles.

Removed TK and the repulse effect on SFL403.

Reduced energy cost on SBD1500 to 150.

Moved 'Dev Box' to its own document section in the F1 HelpMenu.





6/30/09

Reverted settings to an older version from last year. Many of the updates that took place afterward haven't been reimplemented yet. Any lingering issues, or bugs with this rollback will be dealt with in the weeks to come.

Added preventive measures against the Koth glitch. Turned Koth back on with older large rewards. Game is set for every 3 hours.

Took measures against a server crash that used to occur.

Please be advised to sell any credits you have. Sell price has been matched to the buy price so you can get your money back. You will lose the money you invested in them now in a later update should you hold onto them.

Adjusted AutoGun AT, Flak, Rocket AP and Maser requirements. Maser still disabled.

Vehicles to be worked out at a later date.

Changed the class category for Conscripts to "Training".

Turned NeuroTAC class on as-is for preliminary testing. Don't expect additions anytime soon.



12/18/08

Big maps back.

Left DropShip Recall on command classes, the rest got store recall back.

Removed CalTrops for now.


12/17/08

Nerfed UFG finally.

Added Credit Carrier, sells credits to players with the required attributes. If you buy from store its going to cost ALOT more.

Added some armor to the Shimmerboard.

Caltrops no longer hit your teammates. Lowered damage a bit, and you cannot use them in the Gladiator Event Arena.

Readded the Gamma, Zeta, and Epsilon Roamers.

Major resource points experience beefed.

Removed extra turret/vehicle damage from Proton Sphere.

Lowered energy cost for Teleport Charge - Recall.

Added Innate DropShip Recall to all classes, this does not require STS but has a longer prefire and you must stand still to dropship, as well as consumes your max energy.

Added off map area for Pirates to spawn, will add aliens spawn soon.




12/15/08

Well well well, we meet again Eol. And as you can see, there have been many a chance to the zone.

First off we've got a new map!(well, not really, just rearranged to be more suited for flagging)

Then we've got King of the Hill(quick games, hardly any reward, yeehaw!)

Credits are now purchasble in the store, they sell for the same amount you buy them for and droppable!

Grizzly, Rapier, Slick, and APC are all now purchasable through the store(Yayy!! 2 new vehicles!)

Trident, Leviathan, and Rhino will all spawn at certain populations. This should be interesting.

Maser turrets have been made unusable, sell the ones you have left before I remove them if you want money back.

Shimmerboard has been added and is only usable by DropTroopers. This is just a slightly slowed down version of deathboard with shimmer field.

Caltrops have been added to the store, unsure why these weren't thrown in prior to now, actually, as they've been ready for a while.



10/16/08

Reduced the reload time on Assassinate.

Schrap mines should work again.

Maser Turrets should work again.

Lieutenants can now drive the Atlas.



10/15/08

Up'd the cost on ExoSuit, lowered the armors a little.

Remove Schrap mines from Captain.

Tweaked maser turret settings a little, hopefully it'll stop what's been going on.

Lowered energy drain from Assassinate and brought it to a 1 swing clip, let's see if this balances it a little.

Harriers got Repulsor Field Class C back.

Reload delay of disruptor was tweaked up, vehicles as is weren't worth their cost.


7/30/08

You can now sell ExoSuit to get it out of your inventory.

KoTH is removed, thx for abusing guys!!


7/12/08

Sorry about the last notes, those new vehicles definitely aren't ready to be added to public and there was a mixup.

Anyways, we've lowered Atlas HP to 400, and shifted armors around a bit, definitely lowered the drain protection.

Also Climb++ATL now cost 15 energy to use, it's a start for now and we'll see how that goes.



6/30/08

You can now go from a pack to the Atlas(hopefully helps with getting it stuck in lava)

Lava kills slower now(once again, hopefully helps with Atlas)

Hopefully the second Atlas spawns now.

KoTH moved down to 3 hours. and will only start in pub 2 once it gets 45 people.

AP Rocket Removed from FS, no idea why it had that.

Demolition Charge removed from Infil.

Demolition Charge Light was added.

There is now an attribute guide in place to help out anyone looking for help in that area.




6/24/08

Fixed a few problems:

FCU mess straightened out.

Dynamite Bundles were pulled at the last second before the update, they are being reworked and renamed.

Second Atlas should spawn now.

Fixed some problems with Factories.

Exos can move in the dropship now.

Can't fire weapons aside from the built in ones from Exo anymore.

Added 2 new area spawns (G6 Building, and the other South East Area)

Field Surgeon can drive the Ambulance now.

Plasma Projector was up'd in price, the left and right bolts wont hit minimum range anymore, and the energy cost is now 50.



6/18/08

LOTS LOTS LOTS! Where do we start

Added a vehicle system, you buy parts from the Vehicle Parts Production Center in the DropShip, then bring them to your teams factory and build them there.
The pricing of vehicles are as follows:
LandNaut Basic is 50,000 as well as 15 Titanium Alloy, 2 Commerce needed.
LandNaut Ambulance is 40,000 as well as 15 Titanium Alloy, 2 Commerce needed.
LandNaut APC is 60,000 as well as 15 Titanium Alloy, 2 Commerce needed.
Harrier GV-s is 135,000 as well as 25 Titanium Alloy, 3 Commerce needed.
Harrier GV-s A2 is 115,000 as well as 20 Titanium Alloy, 3 Commerce needed.
Slick is 75,000 as well as 10 Titanium Alloy, 1 Commerce needed.
APC is 25,000 as well as 5 Titanium Alloy, 1 Commerce needed.

ExoSuit is buyable from the Vehicles section of the Store.

Added Holotaunt EZ Grenade

Decreased the cost of Holotaunts

Lowered base damage on Schrapnel Mines

Reprorgramming Kit was removed, Reprogramming Chip was increased in price.

Lowered AntiStealth distance on the organic sensors, the pixel distances were just quite absurd.

Fixed the bug that let players place Tier 2 Walls on the move, and carry high quantities of it.

Changed projectile graphics on Incendiary grenades to make them more grenade looking.

Retesting harriers being able to go over green physics since they're pretty easy to kill with everyone having something to hurt them.

Slowed some classes down making them comparable to others|

Marine is a mix between Heavy Weapons and Infantry so it runs like one.

Drop Trooper is here to spend the majority of its time on a pack, board, or other vehicle so it's been slowed down on foot a good margin.

Combat Medic and Field Surgeons were running around way too fast so they've  been slowed them down a touch, lets see how this goes and we'll take it form there.

Added FCU - Medium Duty and Tier 2 Turrets. 
Tier 1 is MG and Plasma Turrets.
Tier 2 includes Maser and AP Rocket Turrets.
Tier 3 is now AT and Flak turrets

Add a prefire graphic to Store Recall, hopefully it helps people realize that you have to stand still for about 10 seconds to use it!

Plasma Projector are now individual projectiles(if all 3 hit, they will do more than the damage of just one) and the graphic was changed and damage was increased.

BlackOps and Infantry lost access to Plasma Projector, and Sergeant was given access.

Added S-LAW(Structure LAW) that will deal a larger amount of damage and trigger on structures or at lifetime only. This is to combat the new tiers of turrets.

Lowered carry weight on Ammo - MG 20mm DPU hopefully making it more accessible.

Changed the color of some of the classes uniform, so they are more easily discernable on the battlefield, SL was darkened, Captain brightened, Sarge & LT dont look the exact same anymore, and Marine was changed.

5 New Resource Points:
1 Major at H6
1 Mineral Point at H3
1 Mineral Point at A5
1 Mineral Point at N1
1 Hazardous Resource Point at I5
The Mineral & Hazardous Points are worth the same as the others atm, unsure if they should be increased atm, we'll see how this goes.

KoTH is back, game is on a 4 hour timer. If it's abused, its gone.


6/3/08

Removed Koth game.

Adjusted some Drop Trooper movement properties.

Took Teleport Beacons away from Squad Leader and gave them to Sergeant and Lieutenant.

Added 3 more Roamer Flags: Delta, Epsilon, Zeta

Adjusted some Newbie Arena requirements.

Fixed some map bugs.


5/30/08

Turned Drop Trooper access back on. I know I said during the public test for the zone I wanted to give NeuroTAC and Drop Trooper a couple more "toys" before they were accessible to everyone, but I feel I might need to go over these classes prior to anything else given to them. This will be a preliminary testing phase for the DT class. The objective is to balance the class where imbalances exist and to make certain the difference between this class and it's counterpart (Jump Trooper) are significant enough. Changes may occur to this class over the next several updates so don't get your heart set on the way it is right now. Chances are it is overpowered in a couple different ways. I use the term "toys" loosely. These classes may just end up getting one new thing. We shall see. A part of this preliminary test is so the community can voice feedback.

Implemented a fixed arena for Newbies only. Players just starting out will be placed in this arena as soon as they enter the zone as long as they meet the requirements for the newbie area. All veteran players will bypass this arena and get kicked straight to Public1 when they enter the zone. You may not even see it on your ?arena lists. Newbies in this new arena will not be restricted to this arena, they can still find their way into Public1.

Reduced the debilitating effect on SP700q and reduced the screenshake.

Changed both Steiner and Maklov AC behavioral mods. Reduced Steiner AC's inner damage a small amount due to lower calibre ammo and also reduced it's minimum range a small amount.

Beefed rewards while you're in the DS. They're still not at the maximum, although this is more of a change to seperate the DS and the store a little further.

VLAWs now hit/trigger on board-type vehicles.

Increased requirements on Biolabs GP6 and Acid Projector.

Increased Hoverboard speeds and adjusted some of it's "bounce" effects. The speeds are just short of normal Deathboard speeds.

Removed the ability to strafe via Vehicle Actuators on Hoverboards. T_T  In the future, it is likely the Vehicle Actuators item will be split into two items. One being an actuator-based item to increase movement and maneuverability, the other to increase strafe/give strafe. Some vehicles you will be able to use both items with, some it will be one or the other.

Removed the ability to use SBD1500 on personal vehicles.

Reduced the amount of time you're allowed to be in the dropship before the server forces you into spec.

Removed crowns from spectators.
~BTook some measures versus the Koth bug that allows players to exploit rewards. Still working on an alternative to fix this glitch completely, however, if it turns out it cannnot be corrected and abuse with this continues, one of two things will happen: 1) Koth will be removed. 2) Private teams will be removed and teams will be restructured similar to the way they were in Alpha; 10 man pub teams without the ability to move to other pub teams freely.~B
Trimmed Koth rewards.

Small damage beef to the secondary incendiary GL round.

Gave personal vehicles sellback prices. I bought the wrong one, oh no!

~BI've been made aware of a bug or glitch that has reared it's ugly head a few times which is causing players to lose their earned stats for their session. I'll be working on pinpointing why this is happening and if it can be corrected over the next couple weeks. Sometimes these things take time. If you have experienced exp/cash loss I'm sorry, but the likelyhood of reimbursing you is close to nil. I'd appreciate it if you could take a quick few minutes to email me in detail what happened and what you were doing when you found you had lost some statistical information. If you were in the dropship and you ?quit, if you were in the middle of a fight and you ?quit (or not in the middle of a fight, but not in an area you can instant quit), if you were in spec when you ?quit, if you were playing for several hours and ?quit. This type of information can help me narrow down the problem if it exists. Don't forget to leave your in-game alias if you submit an email. One thing to keep in mind while playing is to save your session often. You can do this by exiting the zone, waiting a short few seconds, then re-entering the zone. It's much like playing any type of console, or computer game where there is a save, or auto-save feature except we don't have an auto-save feature. This is what I refer to as saving your session. This helps protect your game character from statistics loss due to disconnect, or server crash. Normally a crash, disconnect, or spamout can or will cause data/stat loss. If you are one of the unlucky players that lost stats, try to remember back to how you lost them and then try not to end your session that way again. Safest bet for everyone is probably to teleport/warp to the store, or dropship and enter spec mode from there followed by a quick-quit in order to save your session.~B

Added GL Secondaries: Sheaf for Kuchler GL. Incendiary Round for Maklov GL. Timed Grenade for Titan GL.

Map Changes: Small adjustments, changed color tone on hill-type mounds using lighter grass graphics to simulate depth. Removed a naughty window. :O

Beefed PM z80 inner and outer damages.

Raised ROF on Striker SG and lowered the reload a small amount on both Striker and Stroker SGs.

Recalibrated SiG Arms, Maklov ACW, Striker and Stroker drains; nerfed. They aren't very significant nerfs so there is no need for tears, it was necessary to seperate them in this fashion to prove their worthiness.

Reduced recoils on Stroker and Striker SGs. Also adjusted Striker's price.

Did some alterations for Vehicle Actuators and the personal vehicles that can use them.

Put Auto Turret - AT's minimum range to be on par with ARs.

Lowered Proton Accelerator energy cost per shot to 425; lowered warmup time a small amount.

Gave Reprogramming Chips a sell price; 1% of the actual cost of purchase. Also increased the buy price.

Took Demolition Charge from BlackOps.

Items that create Flight Packs, Drop Packs, Jump Packs, Hoverboards and Deathboards have all been modified to meet the same specifications as the vehicles themselves to help avoid confusion on what class can use which personal vehicle.

Moved the N3 Major Resource to O3.

Turned on a timer for Koth. As long as there are enough players in-game to trigger the timer, it will countdown the entire 2 hours. The timer should be visible via upper right hand corner.

To's Master's-Sergeant's-Apone's:
That's all's thanks' for's reading's. :D's


5/15/08

Map Updated. There is now a Level 3 for the newb zone where Class 2 Pirates will spawn. Class 3 Pirate area was altered, it is now a "No Build Zone" and you can't make turret structures there. There is also a Brig now. For Conscripts fighting in the newb zone they will either be sent to the Brig, or Lava when they kill. One can only hope for a quick death. The B4 building was also slightly altered, it has a newer floor tile graphic and is now labeled as indoor terrain. There are also some various bug fixes in this map update. Aside from bug fixes, lava spawns should be less frequent now.

Added Range Heal for Medic and Surgeon and Range Heal, Advanced for Surgeon. Range Heals heal friendlies in a much greater area than Area Heals and are ideal for healing from a safe distance.

Added Vambrace Ceramax and Vambrace Kevlite. Vambrace Ceramax can be used by any class, Vambrace Kevlite can be used by any non-Ops class.

Large Stim Packs and Energizers are now available via store purchase. I have been asked about these and the existing prices for these types of consumables and have been told they are too high. It is necessary to have them priced the way they are to prevent players from stacking these items and to show how important they are while still allowing the classes that create these items to have an actual purpose.

Dropped SW2002 from Marine.

BlackOps gained SW2002. Going to try this out for a while.

Marine gained access to the AR Secondary rounds.

Gave Teleport Summoner to Field Surgeon.

Reduced reload period for Surgeon's Light Surgery innate ability.

Increased Surgeon's base energy regeneration rate a small amount.

Nerfed energy cost on Emergency Summoner to 400 energy per summon. This should leave the Surgeon with enough energy to initiate treatment.

Corrected many terrain-type settings pertaining to weapons.

Captains can now use converters to create their Energy Cores for the Teleport Charge kits.

Changed LOS properties on Class 3 Commanders.

Added a door to the Citizen's Standard building. It's more of a shed, but you know what I mean. :)

Small adjustment to Titan Arms GL blast radiuses.

Fixed a few more grammatical errors.

Please report any bugs you may find on the forums, or send them to eoladvanced@gmail.com
I've been seeing a lot of things on the forums. Thanks for the feedback. If you wish to be able to have a response from me you can send it to that email. I don't always reply, but it's your best bet. You probably won't see me with a forum account, although I do read the forums and emails. This does not mean I will undoubtably see things your way and change it to suit your needs and your needs only. That is not how this works.


5/9/08 - Small Friday Update

Infiltrator gained access to Ceramax Combat Armor. Armor cannot be worn together with Cloaking devices at all. If you want armor, use armor, otherwise go with cloak. It has been about 5 years since Infil lost Ceramax Armor, I want to see how the class fares with it in this newer Eol environment.

Inflated prices on Stim/Energizer type consumable items in the store.

Reduced public team sizes down to 10 from 12. Increased Private team maxes to 7.

Changed the way crown timers decay on specific terrains. They will decay at a faster rate while you're in the DS, or the Store.

Beefed IHD Generator a small amount.

Reduced rewards for Conscripts clinging to the buffer/non-fire terrain in NZ.

Adjusted Grenade - Incendiary to bounce prior to exploding. This makes them actually have a grenade feel to it, as it matches that behavior.


5/8/08

Increased price on Demolition Charge, LAW and VLAW.

Removed the base kill reward for points.

Added a deduction of cash and experience for killing while a Conscript in the newb zone equivalent to the base reward on kills. It is counter-productive to fight in there, this change reflects how counter-productive it is. In the future it is likely further measures will be taken.

Changed permissions on many items for Marine that were being used on Packs, such as RPG.

Changed some auto bounty settings.

Trying something a little different for pirate-type drops, players on vehicles such as packs or boards will not be able to pick the drops up. If you are hunting NPCs while on one of those vehicles, you'll need to hop off of it in order to pick up drops. Right now this only applies to the actual helmet-type drop, credits are free game.

Increased the maximum amount of Schrapnel mines you can carry to 9.

Added Grenade - Incendiary. Exclusive to non-Ops and non-medical/non-biochemical classes right now.

Added some things to allow mods to better do their jobs with specific rules.

Fixed some grammatical mistakes in descriptions.

Turned off the barrier on teams that was attempting to make them even. There seems to be a bug with this system so players can now freely switch teams during lower arena counts instead of being stuck on 4 or 5 man teams with one pub team at 12. Testing it right now.

Took measures against a bug that allows you to create things like PDBs ontop of physics.

Adjusted some properties to the kits/makers that allow you to build walls, some of them weren't costing energy; that was corrected.

Medium Energizers and Stim Packs are available now via store. They are a bit more pricey than the Smalls.

Rigged Mercenaries Standard and Elite Standard to allow Lieutenants to capture them.

Removed bounty rewards from Spider Gems.

Dropped Reprogramming Kit from BlackOps. Added Reprogramming Chip for BlackOps.

Added Greaves - Blast. There may be some tweaks to this item in the future.

Added another Titanium and Unilenium spawn.


5/5/08

Adjusted some flag drop properties to help prevent against a bug.

Reverted On-Site Store back to a non-safe zone. Apparently players wish to make their personal vehicles in there, and some would like to get summoned out to regroup with a team. So instead of a safe zone, players will get an increased energy recharge rate while in the store to help counter maser spam.

Autogun AT costs full energy to create.

Fixed some map bugs. Everytime I turn around I learn about a new one.

Added two more Major Resource Points. There are about 2 in and/or around 4 different points. This should make for some interesting territorial disputes.

Holo-Taunt GG is now in it's own category called "Taunts".

Conscripts are now restricted to the newb area. Killing while in the newb area will result in a death sentence via lava.

Beefed EXP rewards on all pirate-type helmet drops, including aliens and the pirates located in the newb zone. This is to accelerate productivity and help against the learning curve with newer players.

Put the experience buffers back on Tech, Medic and Infantry. Majority of players that are going to play have already started their characters and it's pretty obvious that a good chunk of people still want to play it out as Conscript. With the pirate helm rewards getting beefed it won't take long to get the 500 experience needed to swap out of the Conscript class.

Took a few measures against a glitch that sprung up. Shouldn't have to worry about it anymore.

Trimmed Blast weapons a bit more. Specifically the BLR and BLMG. Future trimmings will not be noted here, only major changes to the weapon. I'm seeking to find a good median for these weapons so they don't get nerfed into nothingness and are still viable to carry around.

Fixed a weight issue with PP08m and PPAm.

Increased all pack-type armors so its more likely the user will die before the pack itself.

Adjusted a setting prevalent to point-blank damages, reducing the effect it will have on the user so weapons such as Demo Pack aren't as lethal only to yourself.

Changed Reprogramming Kit a little. It'll cost 300 energy to use and it will take 5 seconds to do the actual reprogramming.

Altered some descriptions that were incorrect and fixed the H8 flag glitch.

Dropped access to Area Heal, Superior and Tranq from Medic.

Raised prices on all four Area Heals, adjusted their weights and some of their energy usage per heal.
Area Heal, Superior now costs 3 Tsolvy per use.

Gave Ammo - Blast Cartridge a load sound so you can tell if you've used it, or not. This sound may change in a later update, but is unlikely for now.

Small adjustments to Marine's innate protections and Surgeon's base energy regeneration. Small.


5/2/08

Thanks for participating on Launch day.

There seems to be a problem with the payout of the KoTH game. I want people to have good rewards to look forward to while participating in KoTH, so instead of nerfing those rewards, KoTH will take place around every 2 hours as long as there are 40 people unspecced long enough to trigger the game. I originally wanted KoTH to be more of an event and the focus on teamwork and flagging/basing while waiting for KoTH.

Flag rewards have been changed to every 5 minutes instead of 10. Flags are a good way for Techs to start tightening their skills with base building by building bases to protect those flags. I very much wanted a good CTF element in this zone. Beefed these rewards a little. This should help majority of other players catch up to the players who have already gotten all of that experience.

Nerfed bounty rewards on player helmets. Seems like its overly easy to bounty right now, it should be more challenging. Experience rewards on killing while you have 30k are 10x higher than alpha's and about 2x higher than beta's. Don't bother crying about the bounty nerf, earn it.

Did some minor adjustments to the way bounty is handled in newb zone.

Changed the way one of the ambient sounds was handled around the F9 building.

Raised the requirements on Conscript so you can get a couple more attributes while you're that class before you're forced to change in order to get more.

Added a little more security for the newb zone, now if you're a conscript and you kill anyone, you should get warped to a random portion of the map. This is more of a test right now, and if it works the way I'm hoping it will it will serve as a better alternative than my other plan which was to force prize your character with a deduction of cash and experience for killing. Since this is more of a universal conscript-type change you'll have to rely on NPC kills as Conscript in order to progress and stay away from killing others. In a future update there will probably be "nets" placed on all the warps to keep conscripts from venturing out into Eol too early. Also when a conscript reaches 10,000 current experience while in the newb zone, the conscript should be getting warped back to the dropship at that point. Work together and reap the benefits.

On-Site store is now a safe zone. Good luck with your masers.


5/1/08 - Launch Update

I'd like to thank everyone for helping test the settings pre-launch. :)

For the time being, the experience buffers on Infantry, Tech and Medic have been lifted. This means anyone playing the zone will be able to go directly to one of those three branch classes. Conscript will be there for players who wish to only fight in the newb zone. Play nice.

Increased starting cash to offset the cash deduction upon choosing Tech, Medic, or Infantry. This may not be reverted back in the future. We'll see.

Fixed some of the on-map sprites so you appear to walk under them, ex: trees; instead of appearing to be on top of them.

Did some nerfs to some of the blast weapons, although no one will be able to use these again right away.

Fixed the Shotgun weapons being used to shoot into the buffer/safe area in the newb zone.

Reduced the experience reward on KoTH games, apparently it was too "high".

Beefed attribute costs a bit. Lowered prices on Commerce, Stamina and Vitality to compensate for this change. I want the zone to have good replay value. :)

Changed the auto increments of bounty. Maximum the server will give you is about up to 100 then you have to rely on getting it yourself.

Turned the Q2 doors back to the original idea, must have 25,000 current experience this time to enter.

Adjusted experience payout on kills, bit more if you have 30k, and a bit more from killing a 30k. This change is universal to kills, just think of 30k as a reference.

Fixed a bug with some weapons not being able to fire over lava and certain terrains.

Newb zone pirates no longer drop rewards that will increase your bounty. Beefed an experience reward on one of their helmet drops. Also beefed rewards across aliens and most tiers of pirates. Class 3 pirates also got a beef in Hitpoints.

Small Stims and Small Energizers are now available via store purchase.

Removed Caltrops until I can work out the repping issue.

Made Roamers appear on radar and switched periodic flag rewards down to 10 minutes per reward from 15 minutes.

Decreased min range on Proton Accelerator and beefed a small amount of damage on it.



4/28/08 - Nightly Update (Test)

Restructured portions of the map, store, newb area and the I3 "stuck" island.

Newb area is for Conscripts only.

Adjusted cash leech area and cash rewards.

Scores should be saving now.


4/28/08 - Public Test

The map used here is a new map version simplified between alpha's and beta's maps.
Newb zone is located off-map which will moderate itself in the event a veteran player enters it.
There is an on-map store accessible only through the use of a new innate suit item that all classes have. You have to remain still for several seconds in order to teleport there.
You may have noticed the dropship is back and the enclave is gone. It did not make sense to keep the enclave as the map is about half the size of beta. The dropship is much safer for players, however.

All attribute prices have been adjusted. In alpha it was argued attributes were much too hard to acquire later on in the game, and in beta it was argued that players were being handed their attributes on a silver platter. This should make things challenging but not out of reach. In most of the main attributes you will be able to purchase four at under 10,000 experience each. The Vitality price was decreased because of the sheer fact it was next to impossible to obtain all of them.
New Stamina attribute will give points of energy per purchase. Energy reflects your shields and it's what helps armor tank as much as it does, which is the cause for it's high pricing. It is valuable.

Classes -- There are quite a few new classes now, majority of which were promised long ago, but not all of them are finished.
  -Conscript: The Conscript is a freshly plucked citizen inducted into military service. This is the first class you will be able to pick and this is the class you'll start with. It has an innate weapon called Basic Carbine, which is the standard issue training equipment. The point of the Conscript is to go through training via newb zone to attain the experience to go into the field of their choice. The Conscript is limited in what it can use, but not much is needed to distinguish the pirates in those training areas.
  -Marine: The Marines are a crossbreed of Infantry and Heavy Weapons, able to holster LMGs, MGs, ARs, BRs and majority of the Blast Weapons. They are assault types.
  -MPAC: The stapleman of heavy weaponry, able to use all essential super heavyman weapons; Blast Cannon, Mortars, RR and Heavy Machineguns.
  -NeuroTAC: NeuroTACs take bioweaponry to the next level, they are malicious with chemicals, but have quite a scientific mind. To put it simply, they are advanced Biochem Troopers. (Currently inaccessible)
  -Field Surgeon: Field Surgeons are the primary physicians on the battlefield. They risk their lives to treat the wounded, but this does not mean they're incapable of defending themselves. Surgeons normally work in cooperation with Medics to get the job done. Seniority proves to have it's advantages.
  -Chief Engineer: Chief Engineers are high ranking Engineers able to build impressive defensive units as well as vehicles. Chief's normally have everything under control by themselves, but appreciate Tech's and Engineer's efficiency and determination to learn and advance.
  -Drop Trooper: The Drop Troopers are Jump Troopers that are well versed in aerial combat and are trained to be just as deadly while on foot. (Currently inaccessible)
  -Lieutenants: Lieutenants are a Captain's underling, carrying out his orders and are usually the ones directly involved with overseeing operations. There was a significant gap between the Command tiers so this class should even that out.
  -BlackOps: BlackOps Troopers are the Infiltrator/SciOps crossbreed. They use many advanced weapons and items required to help carry out stealthy assassinations.

On related news, you're now able to use the Skills Screen from the dropship, which means you can change class and purchase attributes from there. This balances out the on-map store, as you can only purchase items/weapons/ammo from there and it also gives STS more of a purpose. You'll also be able to gain more HP while in the dropship than you would if you were to sit in the on-map store. The on-map store is essentially an area you manually teleport to in order to buy supplies. This gives all players the benefit of being able to grab supplies instead of having to spec out, or suicide in order to get to an area to purchase them. On a related note, you won't have to worry about losing your equipment while switching to specific classes at this time, that feature has been disabled for now. You may also notice the freebie items aren't there anymore, either so when you do change to a grunt class frees won't be given to you, you'll need to work for you equipment.

The ability to return to spectator mode has been removed throughout majority of the map. Exclusions include the dropship and on-map store. From those two locations you'll be allowed to spec, quit and change arenas freely.

Flags are still around, although all of them are now either carry, or stationary Major Resource Points. Rewards on Major Resource Points have been increased from what you will remember from beta. There are also 3 new carry flags collared as Roamer's Alpha, Beta and Gamma. These flags are carry and drop and incline you to bring them back to your base to substanstiate larger rewards. Rewards happen periodically for the teams with flags in their possession about every 15 minutes. Carry timers on these flags are about a minute in length and will transfer to the player who killed the flag carrier.

KoTH is still around and activates when there are 50 players unspecced. The cycle period for each game is about 1 hour. This makes KoTH more of an event that you will want to participate in. Rewards on this have also been beefed from what you may remember from beta. The hourly period also serves as a reset for all flags in the game. This should keep people on their toes and the gameplay fresh.

Team sizes have been adjusted, majority of the public teams will be capped at 12 players while private teams will be capped at about 8 players. This is to keep base, flag and koth fights large enough to enjoy.

NPCs are still present. Class 1 Pirates in the Newb Zone, Class 2 Pirates roaming the E, F and G coordinates, Alien spawns in the K coordinates and Class 3 Pirates in the Northeastern part of the map closed off from players under 50,000 current experience.

Vehicles have been removed while a new system can be worked out. Personal vehicles are still present and can be used by the same classes as before, however, the large vehicles will take a bit more time to work out a newer system for. This shouldn't be a problem because no one will meet the requirements for any of the vehicles at this time.

Wall Kits have now been split into Tiers. With each Tier the walls become more durable and reliable. They're also split into ranks as to which Enigineering type can use them, Tier 1 can be used by Tech's while Engy can use up to Tier 2 and Chief can use up to Tier 3. In addition, each wall drops "scrap" when it is destroyed. Scrap can be converted into Alloy via converters; 25 scrap for 1 alloy.

Armor sets have been added. Armor sets are a group of items transfered to you upon purchase that actually cost less than buying individual pieces seperately. There are only a few sets at the moment and they're all low-end setups, so this is mainly directed toward new characters.

Teleport Charge Kits were added to allow players to create their own Charges instead of wasting money buying them. Charges require Energy Cores in order to create. They work like convential energizer kits. Energizer kits and Stim Pack Kits have also changed and are now in a tier-type with small, medium and large stims and energizers.

There are a lot of new items and weapons, many categories in the store got a new addition. There is simply far too many to go over all of them. Not everything here is finalized, so there may be some changes to them in the future.

Slight modification to PR-MO, ROF was lowered and the reload was increased a little.

Kamenev PCAR ROF was increased.

Ammo usage for the ACW and the AS were switched over to 10 Gauge rounds, and the CCS now uses 12 Gauge rounds and the weight was increased a small amount.

1/13/06

Assassinate was tweaked. Lowered the outter Kinetic Damage it does, beefed the Inner Drain a little, lowered the Muzzle and lowered the Energy Cost a small amount.
Assassinate will no longer hit Vehicles (personal vehicles is the exception), or player created walls & turrets. Also lowered the switch delay a tad.

PF Generator was removed from Assassin.

Assassin Suit Shield Protection increased to 7.5%.

Harrier Gv-s now costs 180,000 cash.

Steiner SMG was removed from Infantry, Medic, Biochem & Jump Trooper.

Kuchler 2200 X PSMG was tweaked. Outter Plasma Damage was dropped, Inner Drain was beefed.

The Flag Game was removed.
All Resource Points and Major Resource points will appear now.

Beefed rewards on the Carry-type flags.
More specifically, Elite Unit Standard gained a cash reward on top of it's previous reward status. A similar beef occured to Mercenaries Standard, which gained an experience reward.
The reward rate for these two differs, this is to maintain an importance either of them have.
On a similar note, another Carry-type flag was added called "Citizens Standard" located at K11.
Any class can carry this objective. It has weak rewards compared to the other Standards. Again, this is to maintain the Flag's original importance.

The height Hoverboard can gain is still the same so it isn't as great as Deathboard, so in this aspect it won't be taking JT users away from using Deathboard (you wish).
This change is to accommodate the Medical and Engineering tree classes. It has a good chance at gaining height onto Orange-type physics, but it doesn't have the mobility of the Deathboard.

Jump Trooper lost access to Vambraces.

Medic lost access to Kevlite Greaves.

Assassin is now restricted to PF in the Generator department.

Assassin has gained access to the following to provide the class with some variety:
Cloaking Unit
Shimmer Field
Improved Cloak
Cyclotron
Graviton Gun
Teleport Disruptor
Demolition Charge
Boots - Armored
Boots - Blast
Boots - Thermax

Assassin Suit gained a 1% increase to Rotation and lost some of its protection while gaining some shield drain %.

Assassinate lost its explosive damages.

Blackout Field energy was reduced to -27.5kJ/s.

Assassin's hyperthrust energy cost was increased and so was it's hyperspeed.

SciOps gained access to PR-MO 313X.

Alien Chief hitbox has been fixed.

Made some refinements to the Alien weapons.

Fixed tons of bugs concerning players in vehicles and NPC spawns.




12/23/05

Holiday weekend update!

New Alien Spawn presented!
Alien Chief
Alien Warrior
Alien Arachnomorph
Alien Brute
Alien Electromorph

Aliens drop Credits as well as other things, such as "Organs".
The rewards on the helmet-type drops are twice the amount they would be if it were a Pirate counterpart.

Small increase to experience share percent.

Happy Hunting!


12/19/05

Raised decay times on Clear, Rough, Roadway to 5 minutes and Indoor to 3 minutes.
This will allow longer times on which dropped ammo, prizes, etc will remain before disappearing.

Updated First Aid for Medic. Gave the heal a slight increase and reduced the cost.
This will probably be the last refinement to Medic for some time.

Blackhole recieved a nerf to lifetime and a small reduction in it's pull.

Methane Grenade recieved a higher DOT effect.

Fixed the reload delays on the Dual PP08 & the PPA.

Gave all three PA's a proximity radius. This will allow more skilled marksmen a chance at outter damage, rather than a miss.

'Fixed' the problem with SAW.

Newbie area reworked a little. There will be Pirate Sergeants equiped with an IRLP that spawn in the tunnels.
In addition, the Spider spawn was also changed and will now spawn Spider Hives that are equiped with a lesser devastating attack.

Added a Wall Kit -Improved for Engineers, which build Wall - Advanced and require 5 Alloy to create.
These walls work the same as the Basic's with the same restrictions, however have an increased defense and more hit points.

Turned on Experience & Cash sharing.
The experience share percent is very low. This is intended so that bountier's bodyguards are awarded for protecting their bountier.
These are to encourage teams. Both radius' are limited and require you to be in the immediate area to recieve such rewards.

Fixed some descriptions & sellback prices (yes, Assassinate sellback), again.

Fixed some bugs, yet more still remain.

Updated the guide to reflect some of these changes listed.

Other various tweaks were made that you will just have to discover on your own.



12/01/05

Hyperthrust forward/backward for Assassin are now the same.

Slight tweaking to Assassin weaponry.

Some sellback pricing readjusted.

Added Kuchler PPAm for SciOps.



11/30/05

Newbie area added for players with less than 50k exp and 4 tech/deft (portal is marked)

Tweaked Unittech PDW weight, reload and recoil.

Beefed Maklov PFL a1 again.

Tweaked Foam again, should hit now.

Lowered weight on Jump Armor back to 4kg and adjusted it's price.

Added Grenade - Methane.

Added Steiner 900X SAW.

Added PR-MO 313X.

Added Flak-Mini Launcher.

Added Blackhole suit weapon for Assassin.

Added Maklov PP08m for SciOps.

Fixed some bugs.



11/11/2005

Fixed PCAR and the PPK.

Added Titan Arms AP101 d.

Added Unittech 9mm PDW.

Fixed some bugs involving the Enclave/Neutral Territory.

Upped Foam Dispenser energy cost, Foam should also hit enemy players now.

Ambulance is now restricted to Medic as far as driving/buying it goes.

Bio gained back Ceramax Greaves.



6/10/2005

Updated the Engineer and Tech innate repair.  They work like conventional repair kits, ie activate and select target of repair.

Updated Active Repair kits so they are more effective.

Changed the move model to better support solo play:

forward and backward accelleration is now the same.

Reverse Hyperthrust does not effect accelleration.

HyperThrust top speed is slightly higher than normal top speed.

This will increase whining about backpedaling, but will make it so that a group cannot easily run down a solo player, and it will make weapon
range bands more distinct, allowing players to take better advantage of weapon range disparities.


5/26/2005

Engineer/Tech repair items we re-worked.  Engineers and Techs now have an innate repair that is used in a similar manner to Turret Dismantle

Medic Heal items were re-worked.  Medics now have an innate First Aid ability that works in the same was as Turret Dismantle.

Weaponry on the Harrier A2 were beefed up a bit.



4/18/2005

Projectile/Plasma weapon ballistics adjusted to help define the weapon range bands.
Strafe removed from packs.  




5/14/2004

Medikit and deluxe Medikit were changed to allow area heal, but the radius is very small. You need to be close to heal.


5/4/2004

Captain lost all weapons requiring more than 1 hand to use.

Pirates have lower hitpoints then before.

LandNauts were changed.  You cannot move without pressing Shift+Up/Down. This is to better simulate a vehicle in contact with the ground.

Harriers still use shift+Up/Down for Afterburner.

JumpTrooper Carry weight was lowered to match SciOps.

2/1/2004

Temporarily changed the bounty system:

You will now gain bounty automatically at a set rate as long as you stay alive.
If you die, you lose your current bounty


Cash leech area has been increased so you just have to be in the general vicinity of your team to gain it.

1/7/2004

Secondary AR and Shotgun ammo was modified.

Graviton weapons gravitational pull has been reduced considerably.

Landnaut armor was weakened slightly on both variants.

Landnaut Basic's top speed was increased.

CL5 can no longer be used on a pack.

Boots/Gauntlets now have a small negative effect on movement.

Some defensive fields had their energy use raised, some had it lowered.

AR secondary ammo types have had their carry amount capped at 50 rounds and their prices raised slightly.

Once again the spawn zones have been adjusted.

Prices on Frag Grenades and rifle grenades were lowered.

Rifle Grenades will now damage the user if pointblanked.

9/29/2003

Restored death sounds.

Restored melee weapon graphics.

Adjusted pirate spawn rules.

9/16/2003

Added NPC Pirates for players to fight.  There are a variety of pirates armed with various weapons from the item list.

When killed the pirates will drop a helmet.  This will give the player cash and EXP.  Players with over 10k CURRENT exp cannot pick them up, however.

You can no longer use grenade launchers on packs or boards.


9/15/2003

Infiltrators are now limited to tier 1 secondary armors and fields.

Removed all class restrictions to all soft armors.

RFG has a mild push back effect similar to ERFG.

RFG and ERFG no longer affect team mates.


9/11/2003

Intelligence stat was changed to Technical level.

Technical levels were changed for almost all weapons, all fields, all sensors, and to all equipment.

PDB -- MG is now PDB -- AA/AG (Anti-Air/Anti-Ground)

Flak Launcher was changed to use ammo as per Flak Cannon.

Broadcast Chargers effect radius was increased.  The effect happens in a radius now, so there is no need to select a user.

BioChem lost Medikit, but becomes sole creator of Stims and Steron.

Infiltrators can use Defense Fields.

--More

redid weights on the slug rifles a bit.

Increased energy usage on field generators. They should be a choice, not a necessity.

Removed tech level reqs on all the field generators except DF/CS fields.

Adjusted PDB AA/AG.

SMG's/Pistols had their damage values rolled off to 1. This should make them a little less godly against light armoured targets.

Adjusted soft armour values.

Adjusted weight and armour values on secondary armours.

CAW was lightened.

Flak launcher weight was increased, flak cannon's weight was decreased.





7/31/2003

Soft Armors protection levels were increased 5% across the board.

AR alternate rounds firing rate have all been changed to match that of the Titan AR AP round.

Carry weights have been lowered. The reason this process continues is because we finally get to see what ppl are carrying around with them
when they reach certain STR values.  This is probably the last time base carrying weights will be changed in any significant way.



7/30/2003

Assault Rifles all have a new type of alternate round.  Kuchler has an Incendiary Round, Maklov a Gas Tipped Explosive Round and the Titan Arms has an
Armor Piercing round.  The items cost more than normal ammunition.

Sonic Wave graphic was changed.
Sonic Rifle has a smaller graphic and a Smaller prox than before.

Recoil was removed from all weapons except Stand and Fire and Melee.  Recoil, as used within the context of the game, is not a good modelling device for the 
recoil effects of personal weapons.  

Flak Launcher was adjusted both to make it more effective and to limit the ability to "Wall Flak"

Flak Cannon fire rate was increased.

Rocket turrets now target vehicles/packs, not players on foot.

Mg and Plasma tier 1 turrets had their armor weakened a tad.

Needler/Flechette has their own ammo type now.

Energy usage on cloak/improved cloak/shimmer field was lowered.

Shimmer field gained some extra protection because it is very hard to target someone with a shimmer field on. In game terms this means some extra soft armor 
protection.

JT friction issue was addressed.

Deathboard Slash reload time was increased.  The firing characteristics were changed a bit to make it a little more skillful to use.

Alive time on the RR projectile was decreased.

Proton Beamer graphic was changed. The weapon rof was slown down a tad.



6/5/2003

Standards were introduced.

There are 2 active Standards atm:  

Elite Unit Standard.  This standard gives an notoriety and exp reward every 15 minutes it is carried as well as giving a per kill bonus to the carrier.

Mercenaries Standard. This Standard gives a notoriety and cash reward every 15 minutes it is carried as well as giving a per kill bonus to the carrier.

Adjusted the movement model to be a tad slower, but more smooth then it was before.  Basically base thrust was lowered, as was friction.
This basically slowed things down, but movement feels smooth as before.

Changed the manner in which players stop team projectiles.  Now, you will block team projectiles, you will just take no damage (except for
large radius explosive weapons).  The benefit is now you will not trigger your own teams mines, and your teams autoturrets will no longer TK you.

Plasma weapons were changed in several ways.  First they now get 80% momentum from the shooter as opposed to the 55% of normal projectile weapons.
Next the cost of most plasma weapons was increased to reflect the higher tech nature of the weapons. Lastly, they received a graphical change.

Plasma Cannon(s) lifetime was reduced.

many slug projectile weapons had their shot velocity increased a small amount.

GP6 stun length was reduced. It is now less than the interval between shots from the GP6, which should allow the target to move in a stuttering sort of manner.
The target can still rotate as normal.

Assault rifle(s) weight was reduced.

Slug SMG(s) weight was reduced.

All shotguns and assault shotguns had their weight reduced.

All Slug pistols had their weight reduced.

Incinerator and Flame-thrower's damage was increased a very small amount.



4/17/2003

PLayers can no longer quit, go to spec, or change arena's WHILE in the game world. You can only quick quit, spec, or change
arena's from the DS, for now...


4/16/2003

Flak Launcher and Flak Cannon are now "move and fire".

Removed encumberance rotation penalty on Shock armor and all hard armors.

Squad Leader gains the use of Partial Carapace and Thermax Breastplate at the expense of Carapace and Thermax Shell.

Drop armor Kinetic and Explosive protection reduced a small amount.

Shimmer Field energy cost was reduced.

Improved Cloak energy cost was reduced.

Cloak energy cost was reduced.

Shock armor explosive protection was increased.


-

 
Infiltrators thrust was lowered to the level of JT.  JT's have the highest base move stats except for top speed.
Infiltrators still have the highest base top speed.

PA $$ and PA EZ had their damage changed.

Most projectile velocities were increased a very small amount.

Flak Launcher and Flak cannon projectiles were give a far longer lifetime and otherwise tweaked to be more useful.

Aerial mines were totally changed. They now move around in an area roughly 250 pixels in diameter and the movement is in all directions.

PDB/Turret/Bunker armor was adjusted.

Stims/Energizers were removed from the store.

Infiltrators lose access to all 2nd tier armor.

Kevlite is available to all classes (except Infiltrator)

Shock Armor encumbrance values were lowered.

Many armors had their protection values increased on specific damage types.

Flightpack cost was lowered to 800 cr.

Flame spots will not activate for a half second after it is created.  This should allow moving players to avoid instant triggering of Flame Spots.


3/28/2003

All explosive weapons will now damage everyone in the blast radius (some weapons did this before).

Captain/Sarge/SL's recharge and top speeds were adjusted.

The entry warp grid was tweaked.

3/21/2003

Enabled full collisions.  This means that your weapons will be stopped (collide with) team mates.  This does not mean they will
damage team mates however.  This will also mean that team mates will detonate mines, so be careful with your placement.

3/19/2003

Per shot speeds have been lowered on most weapons.

"Hard" armors have their encumberance modelled by detracting from your move ability. Wearing hard armours will slightly lower your
Top Speed, Rotation, and Thrust.

Changed team Sizes (again).

Redid the warp lio grid.  Hopefully this will help spread people around the map and minimise the likelihood of spawning in a firefight.

New Armor added: Thermax Shell
New Armor added: Thermax Breatplate.

Light and Heavy field converters can now be captured from their owners.  When their HP is in the red zone, Techs, Engineers, Chief Engineers and Captains
can "capture" them by right clicking on them and selecting "take Ownership".

-more

Loaded the wrong .itm and vehicle file version earlier. Sorry :(

Captains/Sarges had their speed increased modestly.

Shock Armor now encumbers the user modestly.

Legbound units now have gravity defined.


1/29/2003

Packs and Boards are changed. You do not buy a "kit" and "build" unlimited items any longer.
Instead you actually purchase the item from the store and use that item till you die or otherwise lose it.

-More

You can no longer drop pack/boards from inventory. You can only "activate" them.

You can pick up a pack/board from off of the ground.  Rigft click on the pack/board and choose the "Pickup?" option.
This will place the vehicle in your inventory.

Lowered energy drain on ERFG.

Re-categorised ammo.

-More

Most projectile weapons shield drain was reduced a very small amount.

Most energy using weapons had thier energy use reduced.

JT Max energy raised to 600.


1/3/2003

Tuning Update:

Many people are questioning this update. It stemmed from the simple fact that armors were too strong, and new players had nearly no chance to compete.  Now things are a lot more balanced in favor of newer players. It is obvious after listening to some of the complaints that the differences between haves and have nots was too significant to be ignored.

The point of advancement in eol is not to be a tank. The point is as you advance you become more specialised in your career path.

Regardless, this zone is a work in progress.


-addendum

Most weapons had their energy drain reduced from 20-40% to adjust for the removal of shield drain protection of most armors.

PA got a mild beef.

Maklov Incinerator had it's damage lowered.
Maklov Heavy Flamer had it's damage type changed.
New Weapon Added: Maklov Flamethrower.

-Maklov Flamethrower and Heavy Flamer also leave "fire Spots" that will do damage if they are walked over.

Particle Accellerator had it's damage lowered and shield damage was lowered.

Armors and fields protection levels were redone.

Command Classes have had their pre-reqs changed. This will not effect existing class holders.

Many classes lost the usage of Dual SMG's.

Duals SMG's had their deftness pre-req increased.

Infiltrator's base move characteristics were changed.

Flak will no longer detonate or otherwise effect Hoverboard or Deathboard. Splash damage will still effect as per normal.

Flak Launcher and LAWS are no longer useable on packs/boards.



12/13/2002

Tuning update:

Dbslash made a little stronger to offset the loss of AP damage.

IRLP was weakened to put it more in line with other pistol class weapons.

Chainsword and Chainfist were buffed a small amount to offset the loss of AP damage.

Standard projectiles were given a VERY modest speed increase.

- Still debating on whether Flak needs to be returned to Medic/BioChem.

12/10/2002

Many adjustments are happening in preperation for new classes and other elements of the game.

Please bear this in mind.

Dropship recall has been completely removed.  A new Teleport subsystem has been added.
The Teleport subsystem is charge driven.  Each type of teleport uses a charge. Currently
there are 3 types of teleport charge: Recall, Random, and Team.  You can only carry one 
of each type of charge at a time.

Weapons and items have been re-categorised.

Grenades can drop on death as per other types of ammo.

The "Armour Piercing" damage category has been removed and replaced with a Psychic/Mental category.
Weapons using AP damage have been updated accordingly.

Medics and Biochems have lost the use of Laws/Demo Charges
Infils and SciOps have lost Laws/Flak

Summoners are less accurate.  Standard teleport summon is relatively inaccurate.  Command class
Summon gets more accurate the higher your rank.

Weapon changes:


Sonic Cannon exceptions fixed
PA's do Plasma damage instead of AP.
Laser class weapons now have no proximity trigger.

New weapon Added: IRLP909a Laser Pistol
New Item Added: Shimmer Field - A different type of visual/sensor cloaking device, the Shimmer Field renders the
                user transparent to normal vision and completely invisible to radar.





9/25/2002

Needler changed so that it only does bypass damage. It does 3/1 bypass with no kinetic.

New Weapon Added: Kuchler GSMG 202a. Guass Submachinegun.

DropShip recall now requires you to stand in place to activate. YOu cannot move and DS recall.
All summoning items are move and fire only.
Fixed teleport summoner drop bug.
All melee weapons shot times were lowered slightly.
Powersword energy usage lowered.

Most projectiles weapons were changed to inherit 50% momentum instead of 75% momentum.



9/4/2002

SR2000k had bypass damage removed.
Maser Cannon had it's inner explosive damage increased
Maser weight trigger adjusted.
You can no longer create packs/boards while on a pack/board.
Reload times and placement times of most mines now made uniform. It takes 2.5 seconds to place most mines.
-This may change as mines may get more lethal.

Hoverboards can Rotate while in the air, but not thrust.
Deathboards can now rotate AND thrust while airbourne.

New weapon added: FusionCorp IRLC911, a Cannon version of the IRL. Useable by SciOps and Heavy Weapons.

If you are one of the basic training classes, you cannot change to another basic training class.
This is a prelude to re-implementation of class tree's.  This means that their will be a definite career
path to follow with several choices based upon which basic training class is selected.
As in WZA, the Command classes will be a seperate tree that can be entered at any time if a player has the appropriate pre-reqs.
Free class changing to classes outside your career path will not be possible without a character wipe.




8/21/2002

Flak Launcher and Flak Cannon are now weight triggered to only hit packers/boarders.
Route range and live time were lowered on all PA models.
DeathBoard normal TopSpeed was decreased and HyperSpeed was increased.

You no longer have your inventory reset when you change from a basic training military class to an advanced class.
You WILL have your inventory reset if you change down to a basic training class.

You no longer get free inventory items when you change from a basic training class to an advanced class.
Basic training classes still start with a basic loadout.

Class prerequisites were all redone and based upon attributes.  The EXP cost of the attributes required is roughly the same as the
EXP level you needed before the change. I am sorry if this messes anyone up, but it is better than using the other system.

7/25/2002

Team sizes are changed again.  The 5 main factions have 20. Minor factions have 15. Private teams have 12.

Items no longer drop when you die. Increased the prices on all items that were formerly droppable.
Electron Beamer energy use was increased to 100 per shot.

Reverse thrust were increased for all classes. Top speeds were reduced for all classes.

The map is coming along well. I am a particularly difficult area at the moment. Screen shots after this portion is complete.

7/14/2002

We are going to try things out from the other side now. The zone has been set to 3 man teams, with a couple of exceptions that will become apparent on their own. ;)

7/6/2002

Lowered the energy damage on most weapons. Some weapons were left unchanged because of their intended effect or percieved characteristics.

Increased the projectile speeds on both Plasma Cannon.
Changed the firing rates and magazine sizes on both guass rifles.
Adjusted kinetic damage downward on the needler.
Increased the inner energy damage on most grenades and explosives.
Lowered Medikit and Deluxe Medikit's effect range to a more manageable size.

For a temporary basis we are going to remove auto turrets from the zone entirely.  Engineers will have content themselves with creating pdb's and other structures that I will be adding shortly.

To further emphasise the importance of the various factions in Eol at the time of the collapse of the civil authorities, I am making pub teams very large.  Everyone can comfortably fit on one of the public teams. This is just a test so dont freak out. :)

Sonic Rifle shot rate increased.
Energy per shot increased on Zap Glove.

   Machine Guns

RR Canister now bursts earlier.

More updates pending... 

5/24/2002

Maser renamed Maser Cannon and is usable by Heavies if they meet the intellect req..
Brought back a previous version of the Maser.
Lowered inner AP damage on the Acid Projector from 8 hp to 6 hp.
Adjusted Partial reload times on the projectile weapons that have clips, magazines, or belts.

Change classes, dont ?wipe.

Added new Item: Blackout Field

2/19/2002

Items lost due to death now drop at the place of death.
Fixed Stealth Generator.
Powercell's weight was reduced.

2/17/2002

Completely redid armor values from top to bottom, including field generators. It is worth noting that, although
armor values are not cumulative and dont add together, they do work in the order displayed on your Inventory list 
from top to bottom. I know this is somewhat counter-intuitive, but that is the way utility items work.

Completely redid the damage check values. I was assigning improper values based upon a incorrect understanding
of the parameters. Item loss do to battle damage should increase. Fields and sensors are more likely to be 
destroyed, armor items less likely. We'll see how it goes.

-The highest chance of battle damage effecting anything is 5% the lowest is 1.5% depending on the item.
-Primary armors and field generators are exempt from battle damage.

Redid the weight values of the packs and boards to reflect this zone, not CTF. Some ppl will look at this as 
a major nerf. However it was never intended that players be able to circumvent weight restrictions AND gain a
maneuver advantage. A JT should not be able to carry full armor and 6 weapons on a drop pack, for instance.

Added new Item: Stealth Field Generator. Any class can use this. It acts like a stealth coating at the cost of
energy.

Heavy Weapons Troopers can now use partial carapace.

2/14/2002

Adjusted SW2002 to not push the target so hard.
Adjusted the Gravitron's radius of effect.
Reduced the energy drain of sensors.
Increased the energy drain of cloak and improved cloak.



2/9/2002

Recalculated the armor values for the secondary armors.
Redid the system for battle damage of utility and secondary armors.

As stated before there are 2 checks performedto see if an item is destroyed. The first check I use to
simulate the potential chance that an item is destroyed in the process of dying. The second check is 
against the items simulated toughness. This essentially the arbitrarily determined resistance to destruction
of the item. A sort of a "saving throw" if you will. A better system would include a modifier from the weapon
that killed the player. Unfortunately we dont have this ability at the present, so we make the best of what is
possible...

Increased all normal and stop weights by 5 kilo's.
Temporarily removed Disruptor.
Temporarily reduced HP back to their pre 1/9 levels except for JT which has 55 HP.

2/4/2002

This is a big update. Expect some things to be tweaked.

Most utilities now have a potential chance to be destroyed and removed from Inventory when you die.
The base chance is 5% that a piece of equipment was damaged. If the check indicates an Item was damaged
there is a 25% chance that it will be completely destroyed and removed from Inventory. If an item is not
destroyed (ie removed) then it is assumed it was repaired. Primary suit armor is uneffected, but secondary
armors (gauntlets/etc.) can be destroyed. No basic equipment items (Items you start with) are effected 
nor are weapons effected (yet muhahahah).

Removed reprogramming kit until a specific parameter is enabled.

Reduced RPG proximity a small amount

CAW now uses 5 energy per shot ( fighting suit powers the weapon)

During this period you will be unable to teleport.  You can still be summoned as normal.

AutoTurrets will give their team 10% of points/cash reward for kills they make. You have to make the kill to get EXP. Sorry. :)
