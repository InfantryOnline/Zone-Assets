Map: Faydon Lake

~B [I:CQ] Faydon Lake~B


**BIG UPDATE HAS BEEN PUT IN REGARDING ARMOR AND ENERGY SHIELDS, READ ZONE UPDATE LIST**

~6 ~B Map System ~B
	
	~B General ~B
		Faydon Lake is the first zone to feature dynamic map selection based upon the population. Faydon Lake is actually two completetly seperate playable maps referred to as the cavern and the lake.
	
	~B The Cavern ~B
		
		Faydon Cavern is utilized when there 30 or less players unspecced at the start of the game (15vs15). Aircraft are not allowed in the Cavern, however ground vehicles are. There are 3 outposts in the cavern playable at all times.
	
	~B The Lake ~B
		Faydon Lake becomes the playable map when their are 30 or more players unspecced at start of the game. This map has full vehicle access ,and the playable Outposts depend upon the population.
		
		~B Lake Outpost availability ~B
			~B 31-50 ~B playing: Outpost 3 (Hill), 4 (Trench) ,and 5 (Island)
			~B 60-79 ~B playing: Outpost 2 (Complex), 3 (Hill), 4 (Trench), 5 (Island) ,and 6 (Factory)	
			~B 80-120 ~B playing: Outpost 1 (Storage), 2 (Complex), 3 (Hill), 4 (Trench), 5 (Island), 6 (Factory), and 7 (Storage)	


~4 ~B Zone Objective:~B

	~B General ~B
		Titan Militia and Collective Military must fully capture every outhpost in play on the Faydon Lake territory of Europa 

	~B Capture System ~B
		In every outpost that is in play there is either 2 (cavern) or 4 (lake) Forcefield control switches and 1 main flag. The actual control of the outpost is solely dependent upon on the main flag, however all Forcefield Control Switches must be fully captured first(takes 15 seconds each).
		

~B New Concepts:~B

        ~B Damage Types~B        
                The weapon damages have been renovated, there are now 6 types of damage(Kinetic, Explosive/sound, Energy/electric, plasma/heat,shield drain, and Vechicle)

        ~B Specializations~B 
                There is now a new specialization feature in place. Players now have options to "specialize" in a combat suit type, or in a weapon type. Specialization in the combat suits allows players to modify their current armor to be more resilient to certain damage types, but less to others. There are four total different combat suit modifications that can be applied to any combat suit if the specialization for that suit is obtained. Specialization in a Weapon type grants players the ability to purchase new attatchments or modifications to upgrade certain weapons that fall under the category of their specialization.

        ~B Outpost Warp System~B
		There are Outpost Warp portals in each home base and every outpost with a flag. Upon walking on these, a player will teleport to the next Outpost that is under their control. If you attempt to warp without owning the next flag, you will warped back to portal.

	~B Classes~B
		Classes function much like they do in the Skirmish series of zones. They contain pre-defined equipment setups with an unchangable combat suit. Classes are not able to change their gear.

	~B Combat Suits~B
		Combat Suits are like classes with pre-equipped armors except no other gear. They are inclusive of your protection, carry weight, and speed. Some Combat Suits have special utilities installed on them, such as a Improved Cloaking Unit for Commando Suit and Captain Teleport and Summon for Captain Combat Suit.

	~B Training~B
		Every item in Conquest requires a corresponding training to use it. Training is the only limiting factor (besides weight) to how you set up your character.

	~B Garage/Hangar~B
		Vehicles are created via menu at a Garage/Hangar terminal, these are located close to each team's base. You must have the vehicle training for the vehicle you wish to make or control.	

~B Vehicle Creation Guide:~B

	1) Make sure you have the Driver class selected or a Combat Suit with less than 15 kg's of weight carried.
	2) Make sure you buy the Vehicle Training corresponding to what you  want to drive through F11 screen.
	3) Locate the Garage or Hangar closeby each spawn area and purchase your vehicle. (Vehicles options will not display if you do not have the cash or training for them.)

	2) Placing bunkers or PDBs very close to the entrance of an outpost is illegal.
	
	3) An entry way the size of a wall must be kept open when fortifying the entrance of an outpost. (To allow fluid movement both in and out of the outpost.)

[I:CQ] Kleos Conquest	
~B Background: ~B
	Titan and Collective forces wage war against each other for control of the planet Kleos. After large mineral deposits had been discovered on a small, remote Collective inhabited planet (Kleos), Titan Militia made a claim to this planet since they had discovered it nearly a decade ago. When several diplomatic attempts at a peaceful compromise failed, Titan's secretary of war Jake Syco offered the idea of a controlled small-scale war in a secluded valley of the planet as a solution to minimize the massive bloodshed that had been so common in previous conflicts. Collective's General Naivatco concurred and began drafting up terms that included the selection of weapons, equipments, tanks, and aircrafts the soldiers could use as well as the conditions of victory. After several months of heated debates over these issues, a complete agreement was reached. Only one question remains: Do you have what it takes to compete against the best in this ~B Ultimate Conquest~B?
